The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net ""yamma"" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him.

This net ""yamma"" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret.

This stick was sent by an Oboo of the Wakelbura to one of the Yangebura tribe (at Blackall). The wood is this of Bedyea tree--which belongs to the Wooltheroo class--of which Oboo is a subclass. The message refers to killing game found in a fenced paddock at Mr Wallaces station near Clermont. The game is Emu and Wallaby which are both of the Wooltheroo class and therefore claimed by Oboo and Wongoo. The messenger delivers a verbal message. The marks are according to Mr Muirhead as follows: [2 drawings, the first marked 'Wallaby' and 'Emu' besides the stripes of decoration, the 2nd drawing is annotated 'This indicates the wire fence at Kilcommon Station'] [2] [2] James C. Muirhead. Note that there is correspondence between Muirhead and Howitt at AIATSIS Howitt papers. I can find nothing else about him.

On the other side of the spear-thrower, in the centre, there are two circles of a smaller size, and pointing to them is a small, rudely carved figure of a hand—the word for ‘hand,’ munya, also means a ‘ meeting.’ From each end of the stick six lines of notches represent the numbers of individuals of other two tribes approaching from opposite directions. As each notch indicates an individual, there must have been a thousand at this meeting. Kaawirn Kuunawarn was then a very young chief ; and as he is now a man considerably over sixty years of age, the meeting must have been held immediately previous to the occupation of the country by the white man.

The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net ""yamma"" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him.

He had had personal contact with Aboriginal people throughout his life, from when he was a small boy in Queensland and, from the late 1860s, in New South Wales. This contact may have led him to recording the names of Aboriginal people associated with particular objects in his collection, at a time when this was rarely done. Milne seems to have begun actively collecting Indigenous artefacts in the early 1880s and was still acquiring objects a few months before his death in 1917. His work with the NSW Railways (1876-1917) enabled him to meet a broad range of people who facilitated his collecting and associated activities like visiting Aboriginal sites. From at least the time he lived at Orange NSW (1906-1915), and later at Ryde (1915-1917), near to Sydney city, he displayed his collection at his home. In addition to a large collection of Aboriginal artefacts, Milne's collection included artefacts from the South Pacific and prehistoric implements from Egypt, France and England. In his will dated 12 December 1916, Milne bequeathed his ?Anthropological collection? to the ?first Federal Museum opened in the Federal Capital?. The collection remained at Ryde until early 1931 when it was acquired by the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra.

For those interested in Yolngu language and culture, additional written comments will be added here in due time, to aid in your understanding of Yolngu grammatical structure as well as to expand your vocabulary.    A bit about Galitju... as well as making an appearance in the feature film Yolngu Boy, Andrew Galitju is known throughout Arnhem Land and the 'Top End' of the Northern Territory as a legendary hunter, cross-cultural educator, and all-round nice guy.    When I first met Galitju some 10 years ago, it was with Yolngu friends who paid him a visit in order to purchase turtle meat from his deep freezer. There is always a ready supply of magpie goose, stingray, fish, turtle and other culinary delights in Galitju's house!

The canoe is no good, it rocks too much. We have all been seasick. Send tucker & tobacco to Shoal Bay, our bellies are empty.”    The reason for the stick being shaped like a cone is to show that the sender had travelled in a canoe from the Island. The wavy lines in the canoe represent the sea-sick passengers; “Him belly jump about all same kangaroo”, explained the dusky gentleman who gave me the stick.    The marks are made by fire, & also by a sharp-pointed instrument, but the boy could not say whether it was a spear-point, a knife, or a piece of broken glass.

Normally I would have had quite a few bids on the piece by now, but only have 2 watchers.

I was told at the time I bought several artifacts from the collection, that the original owner was elderly and retired.  He went back to his former homeland in Europe. The surname was pronounced Clews, Clews, Cloose...not sure about the spelling as the name was verbally stated.

She wrote: ""I figured out that the small waves at the end of the lines in picture one (4696/97) are hyphens. So If I’m not mistaken most of the missing words are actually just endings. The only words missing in the account of the shipwreck are what I interpret as “Ausfahrt”, “Herfahrt” and something illegible with the German ß at the end. Therefore, it might be something old I don’t know.As to picture two (4700), the sentence does not really make sense, especially the verb “trägt” but I’m almost certain my interpretation of the handwriting is correct in this case. Maybe the author himself left out a word.""    Piers marked up location info ("".... W. Australien) and material in far right column for review by Anneke H. She wrote in reply: ""What I can say for certain is that the horizontal red circle to the right contains “cm lang Australien”. Which of course doesn’t make any sense. The “cm lang” is part of the description of the message stick (29,5cm long). The “Australien” may be the extension of the column to the right (vertical circle). Concerning the right circle I’d say the first word starts with a capital G and I would bet it continues over the next line because the next word starts with what looks like an h or f. There are not many German words this length starting with an h or f. It does look like “Gef-hart…horn” but that’s not even a word. I’ts very likely the passage end with “Carl Sahl in Sidney” but to be honest, without your hint I wouldn’t have read “Carl” because the ending is that blurry. What’s really interesting is the modern, not Sütterlin e in Sidney.     I can’t really make sense of the writing in the horizontal circle to the left containing W. Australia but noticed some oddities there as well. The hand writing looks different from the rest. First of all it’s written in pencil instead of ink. And the capital A looks different and a lot newer. It’s possible this was written later and by a different person. The numbers following the “W. Australien” look like this person referenced a different section or message stick. If you have the corresponding files “2582 u[nd] 2233/36” they might give you a hint on what the author tried to reference. And he had a terrible handwriting, that’s for sure.""    Piers replied: ""Thanks Anneke,   This is really useful. I had incorrectly guessed that ""cm lang"" was ""sammlung""!    The crossreferences to other artefacts aren't usually helpful. Often they are preceded by ""dgl."" which stands for dergleichen and the comparison is usually on the basis of visual similarities rather than origins.    My bad guess for the words preceding W.Australien was something like ""dorf__ W. Australien"". There are very few settlements in the north west of Western Australia, where I suspect the artefact comes from, but the word doesn't like any village I know from that area. (In fact, I lived in that region for three years.)    Thanks again for taking the time with this,  Piers""    Anneke replied: ""“Dorf” could be possible but the first letter is a little too small to pass for a capital D. Plus, the capital W and A are not written in Sütterlin style. Therefore it seems likely the author would have written a modern D as well. Yet again, this is just a wild guess. Said letter could also be “v” followed by “o” and… something “h”-ish. Maybe “f” but “h” seems more likely because the lower… how do you call that? Anyway, the lower part of the letter is not strait but bent.    In writing that I just realized the next word is most certainly “sicher”. What I first thought was “u” looks more like “i” followed by “c”. That would make “…h sicher W[est] Australien”. Does that make any sense?    And a minor addition to the part on the right (it seems I’m having way too much fun deciphering this): if the first two lines are still written in Sütterlin, the first word on the second line could be “herrn”. That would make “Ge…- herrn Carl Sahl in Sidney”. Again, all the letters in Sahl and Sidney look much more modern than the rest, so the two words in the beginning could contain a mixture of old and new letters. Anyway, I doubt that whatever is written there contains a specific location.    I hope that helps. If you come across another illegible passage, feel free to ask me!

It just says message stick. It looks like a cigar. Nora Pearce and June Simmons.’ Curatorial note: ‘Message stick, Australia. There was much discussion amongst anthropologists in the late nineteenth century about the use of message sticks in different parts of Australia. It was thought that they were widely used and would have served a range of functions such as signifiers of safe passage through new territories or as invitations. It has been suggested that the notches on the stick probably acted as reminders rather than as a language that could be read. Today they stand as an icon of Australian Aboriginal culture. This particular message stick was found with the donor's father and grandfather's papers after their deaths and little is known of its provenance or use.

Happily she met my father in Tennant Creek at that time also!

1028,,Description of Woiwurrung message stick communication,72,"From Brough Smythe, R. 1878. The Aborigines of Victoria: With notes relating to the habits of natives of other parts of Australia and Tasmania. Vol. I. Melbourne & London: John Ferres. p133:     ""When a [unspecified Victorian] tribe is encamped, it is not permitted to any other tribe to approach the camp without warning. Bent on revenge, or with an intent to murder, or for the purpose of stealing a young woman, a warrior will sometimes invade a camp in the night and seek to effect his purpose, but such enterprizes are not of very common occurrence. Whether for friendly intercourse or for war, the tribe which seeks a meeting must give notice of its coming in due form. A messenger (We-ar-garr), whose duty it is to proceed to the camp and state the intentions of the visitors, or to invite them to come to the camp of his tribe, is formally appointed by the principal man of the tribe, assisted by the old men in council. The young men are not allowed, under any circumstances, to take part in such deliberations as may be preliminary to so important a matter as a visit to or the reception of another tribe. On very solemn occasions two ambassadors or messengers are appointed; ordinarily, only one. The messenger has to carry a token, by virtue of which he passes safely through the lands of the several tribes. The token is a piece of wood, eight or ten inches in length, sometimes round and sometimes flat, and seldom more than one inch in thickness. On it are inscribed hieroglyphics which can be read and interpreted, and which notify all persons of the nature of the mission. If the mission is a friendly one, the stick is streaked mostly with red-ochre (Werrup); but if unfriendly, or for the purpose of demanding satisfaction for injuries done, or for war, then it is mostly streaked with white-ochre (Ngarrimbul). The principal man, in putting this stick into the hands of the messenger, and having named the tribe for which the invitation is intended, says, “You hold this now” (Koong-ak kinee Mirrambinerr). “Look out and find plenty of blackfellows” (Yane-wat benjer oonee kolen). “You tell all blackfellows to come here” (Toombooni boole-anin kolen-yan-an niool or Tom-buk U-mar-ko Koolin Ner-lin-go).""",,1878,terminus ante quem,,4,1,,,"On 30 August 2018, Barry Blake wrote to Piers Kelly: ""The language is the language of the Melbourne area, which I was calling Woiwurrung.

The stick may have come from from any of the WA areas he explored, and dates.... who knows.  I found the stick amongst my father's effects while he was very ill and close to death. I asked him about it but he couldn't even remember that he had it. I have bull roarers and boomerangs that Wells left to my dad. He had been given them by various Aboriginal people- probably in WA, though he did explore in SA until he was 73.    My wife and I have lived and worked with Aboriginal people for over 40 years in the NT. When I showed the stick to some of the Tennant Creek men they did not respond much. They would have told me had they any knowledge of such an object. We likewise have been given a plethora of artefacts from the Tennant Creek/Barkly Tableland region.    I have tried looking on the WWW for images of similar things but only found much cruder message sticks and so that is why I contacted you.

In a quick search of the database I've found this polished sandalwood style as far north Roebourne and as far south as Rottnest Island.     You will notice that this one (on the far right) from the British Museum is very similar and it's from the Murchison district: http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=505450&partId=1&searchText=message+stick&images=true&page=1    I can give you access to the message sticks database-in-progress if you like, but it still needs a lot of tidying up. Just let me know and I'll generate log-in details.    Would it be possible for me to include your artefact in the database too? It's certainly a fine piece of work, and other experts might have more to say about it than me.     All the best,    Piers  P.S. Do you remember which university researchers you contacted in WA? I would be keen to know if anybody else is working in the area of message sticks. """,1,1543;1544;1545

Zum Teil sind die Zeichnungen der Tjurunga und Schwirrhölzer auch mit Nummern versehen, deren Zuordnung jedoch unklar bleibt. Sie können weder mit den Original-Objekt- nummern von Hermann Klaatsch, die teilweise noch auf den von ihm gesammelten Objekten erhalten sind, noch mit den Objekt- nummern in der Klaatschsammlung des Rautenstrauch-Joest- Museums in Übereinstimmung gebracht werden. Es liegen Zeichnungen oder Pausen von elf Tjurunga bzw. Schwirrhölzern mit Nummern sowie Zeichnungen oder Pausen von fünf Tjurunga bzw.  Schwirrhölzern ohne Nummern vor (zum Teilin zwei Hälften sowie Vorder- und Rückseite gesondert gezeichnet).  Neben den Tjurunga- und Schwirrholzmustern gibt es auch zwei sehr ausdifferenzierte Muster von länglichen Objekten, die wegen der vielfältigen enthaltenen Informationen aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach Botenstäbe darstellen. Eine angedeutete Schnur, befestigt an einem Ende des länglichen Stabes, weist jedoch auch auf eine Nutzung als Schwirrholz hin. Während eines der Botenstabmuster lediglich geometrische Längs- und Querschnitte aufweist, ist das andere mit geometrischen Schnitten und einer figürlichen Darstellung versehen. Ausführliche Erläuterungen am Rand der Zeichnung erklären die Striche oder Schnitte auf dem Holz als kalendarische Angaben (Tage, Monate, Mond) und verweisen außerdem auf drei Stämme, die gemeinsam einen Corroboree abhalten. Die figürliche Darstellung ist „The strange king"" betitelt. [37]  Wie weitere Notizen auf diesen (zweiteiligen) Blättern belegen, wurde dieser Botenstab in Daly River (im westlichen Arnhem Land, Nordterritorium) von einem Mitglied des ,,Mullock Mullock Tribe” angefertigt. Dem anderen Botenstabmuster sind zwar uach ergänzended Erläuterungen hinzugefügt, es existiert aber keine Herkunftsangabe.  Wie mehrfache Erwähnungen von Botenstäben in den Briefen an Schoetensack belegen, war Klaatsch an dem Phänomen dieser einfachen Nachrichtenübermittlung sehr interessiert. [fn:61: So z.B. in Brief Nr.14 und Brief Nr. 33 von Klaatsch an Schoetensack, PHK] Auch zeichnete er die Anordnung der Einritzungen in einem Brief an seinen Heidelberger Freund auf. Allerdings zeigte er sich enttäuscht von der profanen Bedeutung der Zeichen: Die diagonalen Striche in die eine Richtung bedeuteten nichts anderes als ,,Unser ,tribe’ kommt in dieser Richtung” und diagonale Striche in die gegenläfige Richtung ,,Euer ,tribe’ soll aus der anderen Richtung kommen”; die aus diesen aufeinander zulaufendedn diagonalen Strichen zusammengesetzen Winkel bedeuteten: ,,Dann wollen wir uns treffen und zusammen Corroboree abhalten”. Klaatschs ernuuchterter Kommentar dazu lautet: ,,Ich hatte mehr complicirte Dinge erwartet und erhofft, werde meine Studien fortsetzen”[fn:62: Brief Nr. 14, S.25, von Klaatsch an Schoetensack vom 5.-15 Oktober 1904, Telegraphenstation Floraville bei Burketown, PHK]"" p38    In Erckenbrecht, Corinna. 2010.

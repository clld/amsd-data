[M Morris 2021]    In February 1869, the Police Magistrate at Gayndah wrote to the Colonial Secretary asking permpission to pay a reward to three unnamed Aboriginal men who apprehended Jacob and handed him to the policd (QSA ID ITM846848, 1869/609). The letter was marked 'Await conviction'. He was charged with raping Jane Knott and Amelia Reichmann, the wives of two shepherds on the Ban Ban and Ideraway runs (Maryborough Chronicle, 25/2/1869:2). Jacob was tried at Maryborough in April and sentenced to death (QSA ID ITM 16935). The Executive Council confirmed his sentence in May (QSA ID ITM844829, 1869/133), and he was executed on 17 May (QSA ID ITM846853, 1869/1786). There is a detailed account of his last days and his death in the Brisbane Courier (18/5/1869:2). An escape attempt could only have taken place in April or May 1869. No sign thus far. Nehemiah Bartley sold a parce of land at Enoggera to Ratcliffe Pring between 1867 and 1871 (QSA ID ITM3309775). Pring was Attorney-General from 1865 to 1880. He died in 1885. [Jonathan Richards University of Queensland email correspondence to Lindy Allen Nov 2021 and forwarded to M Morris to add to the Brough Smyth record Dec 2021]    ADDITIONAL SOURCES  Correspondent Robert A Johnstone claims that a  "" a full account of this incident can be seen in Mr Bartley's reminisces"" (Johnstone, 1904: http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article22267154).  These reminisces would be:  Bartley, Nehemiah. 1896. Australian pioneers and reminiscences (illustrated): Together with portraits of some of the founders of Australia. Brisbane: Gordon and Gotch.  I have not been able to find Jacob’s story in here but it may be confused with accounts in the Chapter titled ‘Blackfellow Criminals’  on p335.   Meanwhile, in Bartley’s earlier book there is a very brief mention of the incident on page 185:  Bartley, Nehemiah. 1892. Opals and agates : or, Scenes under the Southern Cross and the Magelhans: being memoirs of fifty years of Australia and Polynesia: with nine illustrations. Brisbane: Gordon & Gotch.    STORAGE LOCATION  Nancy Ladas and Robert McWilliams noticed that the object had not been barcoded, and thus its storage location was unclear. This might have been because it was provisionally marked as ‘restricted’ and the women doing the barcoding did not want to view it. Robert McWilliams and Piers Kelly searched the original cabinet at 84/15 but didn’t find it there. They then searched Queensland cabinets, including the restricted storage area but didn’t find it. Later in the day McWilliams found it at the back of the original cabinet.   McWilliams believes that the white dot on the object may be a faded auction marker that was originally green.

The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory.

It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message.

(8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net ""yamma"" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret.

(2) Message stick sent to me by Mr JF [insert] J.C. [end insert] Muirhead--used by the Wakelbura tribe. All message sticks are painted. This stick was sent by an Oboo of the Wakelbura to one of the Yangebura tribe (at Blackall). The wood is this of Bedyea tree--which belongs to the Wooltheroo class--of which Oboo is a subclass. The message refers to killing game found in a fenced paddock at Mr Wallaces station near Clermont. The game is Emu and Wallaby which are both of the Wooltheroo class and therefore claimed by Oboo and Wongoo. The messenger delivers a verbal message. The marks are according to Mr Muirhead as follows: [2 drawings, the first marked 'Wallaby' and 'Emu' besides the stripes of decoration, the 2nd drawing is annotated 'This indicates the wire fence at Kilcommon Station'] [2] [2] James C. Muirhead. Note that there is correspondence between Muirhead and Howitt at AIATSIS Howitt papers. I can find nothing else about him.

The writer has in his possession a specimen which was made by Kaawirn Kuunawarn, the chief of the Kirræ Wuurong tribe, and which is a facsimile of a summons issued by him long ago to three tribes, to meet his own tribe at a favourite swamp and camping-place called Kuunawarn, on the east side of the River Hopkins, and represents their approach to his camp. In the centre of the flat side of the spear-thrower is a carved circle of about an inch and a quarter in diameter, which represents the camp of Kaawirn Kuunawarn. Near it are three notches on the edge of the stick, and two lines and two dots on the flat side, pointing to the camp, which form his signature ; and, at the hooked end of the stick, three lines in shape of the letter Z indicate his presence. Four rows of notches, extending from each end of the stick to the camp, indicate the numbers of individuals of the two tribes approaching from opposite directions. On the other side of the spear-thrower, in the centre, there are two circles of a smaller size, and pointing to them is a small, rudely carved figure of a hand—the word for ‘hand,’ munya, also means a ‘ meeting.’ From each end of the stick six lines of notches represent the numbers of individuals of other two tribes approaching from opposite directions. As each notch indicates an individual, there must have been a thousand at this meeting. Kaawirn Kuunawarn was then a very young chief ; and as he is now a man considerably over sixty years of age, the meeting must have been held immediately previous to the occupation of the country by the white man. Of those who attended it there are only four individuals now alive, viz., Kaawirn Kuunawarn, Jamie Ware, Jim Crow, and Helen Crow.""

James Dawson's natural history collection was displayed in a room at the Shire of Hampden offices after being built in 1885/86 until the Mechanics Institute was rebuilt in 1890. The collection was then housed in the ""Museum Room"" on the second floor. Dawson had requested a second floor be built to ensure his collection would not be kept in damp rooms. His will and probate papers show that he left his natural history  and native weapons collections to the Mechanics Institute Museum, all of which had been housed there for the past 7 years on his death in 1900.    Unfortunately the collection was broken up with a section transferred to the State School in 1936 and other items to the Higher Elementary School at some stage. The latter school was destroyed by fire in 1940 and the State School in 1965. All records etc were lost in both fires, and also the museum collections.    The Camperdown Historical Society was formed in 1960, firstly with no premises. A small ground floor room at the Mechanics Institute was then provided, with little display room. In 1984 the Town of Camperdown council provided our current premises which allow for a good amount of display space.  We have a small collection of aboriginal artefacts which mostly came from the collection of Dr Hope who looked after the Aboriginals at Buntingdale Mission near Birregurra. He was apparently given items in payment for his services. These were housed for some years at Chocolyn School (near Camperdown) until it closed. They were then stored by a local resident before gifting them to our Society.    We have double checked the items we have but unfortunately none resemble the description of the item you requested.    As you have deposited funds into our account but we are unable to help would you like photos of some of the items we do hold?  If you would like a refund please provide your bank account details.

The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net ""yamma"" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him.

It was made for him by ""the native doctor who was to accompany [Unaipon] on his northern trip as interpreter"".     There are at least three avenues of inquiry:    1) It would be worth finding out about Unaipon's northern trip, presumably this means north in relation to Adelaide where The Register was published. If the identity of the interpreter could be discovered this would help isolate the linguistic area associated with the message stick (Unaipon's own affiliation is Ngarrindjeri). The preceding article in the Register is here: http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64244883    PK contacted Tim Rowse on 27 August 2019, who suggested contacting Philip Jones.    Other ways to narrow the search would be to find these names of people ""Warta Yunna"", ""Thumgara"", ""Kow Wona"", ""Mulgarra"", ""Quenra"", ""Mindala"", ""Bungala"", ""Matharoo"", ""Oora"", ""Kow Dull"", ""War Tura"".     2) Identify the language used in the interpretation.  Special clues for the language are   thumgara=dew  kow wona= thunder cloud  oora = wild grass bark  kow dull= wild potato  wommena= boomerangs    In Chirila lexical dataset:  dew = cannot find equivalent to thumgara  thunder = koːɹanna or koːɹunna in Parnkala, koːɹoːna in Wirangu, koːnoː in Yalarrnga (too far away)  wild potato = cannot find equivalent to kow dull    wongela= boomerang on Barcoo river (Queensland or SA?)  wungela = boomerang in Yambina (too far away)  waŋala = boomerang in Yuwi  wunggela = boomerang in Blackall-Barcoo River (probably QLD)  woomera= boomerang according to 'Aboriginal Names of Places with their Meanings, etc' (this could just be a mistake since woomera is Eora word for spear-thrower, after which the place derives its name)    According to Curr boomerang is panketyi in Ngarrindjeri.    So far the best lead is Parnkala and the adjacent Wirungu language. However in the Barngala dictionary based on Clamor Wilhelm Schurmann returns:  dew = yarlda; boorgoo  thunder = goorrana  cloud=mabinya; malgoo; baloowara  boomerang = wadna [used in Port Lincoln only for killing fish]    3) Continuing from the above, of the 13 individuals mentioned in the interpretation, four have names that are glossed as nouns. This suggests that these might be totem names:  Thumgara (Dew)  Kow Wona (Thunder Cloud)   Chief Oora (wild grass bark)  Kow Dull (wild potato)    On this line of inquiry it might be worth looking at AustKin for totem systems north of Adelaide that include these names.     The name Matharoo could be a moiety name, per Arabana moiety matthurie (the other moiety is kirawara)",,"The message in question, of which diagram is shown, contains a war order from Warta Yunna, chief of all the surrounding minor chiefs.

The particulars are known only to the Karadja ""Wise Men"" of the tribes.""    Edmund Milne (1861-1917) was born in England and emigrated to Queensland with his parents 19 months later. He had had personal contact with Aboriginal people throughout his life, from when he was a small boy in Queensland and, from the late 1860s, in New South Wales. This contact may have led him to recording the names of Aboriginal people associated with particular objects in his collection, at a time when this was rarely done. Milne seems to have begun actively collecting Indigenous artefacts in the early 1880s and was still acquiring objects a few months before his death in 1917. His work with the NSW Railways (1876-1917) enabled him to meet a broad range of people who facilitated his collecting and associated activities like visiting Aboriginal sites. From at least the time he lived at Orange NSW (1906-1915), and later at Ryde (1915-1917), near to Sydney city, he displayed his collection at his home. In addition to a large collection of Aboriginal artefacts, Milne's collection included artefacts from the South Pacific and prehistoric implements from Egypt, France and England. In his will dated 12 December 1916, Milne bequeathed his 'Anthropological collection' to the 'first Federal Museum opened in the Federal Capital'. The collection remained at Ryde until early 1931 when it was acquired by the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. It remained there until the Institute's collections were transferred to the National Museum of Australia in 1985.",Unknown,1931,terminus ante quem,,2,1,5,56,57,,"The message stick is associated with the ""Mulga and Lachlan"" tribes in New South Wales.

On this basis the best approximation would be Ngiyambaa for the Mulga tribe.     Using John Oxley's journal of 1820, Milne sought out the desecrated burial site of a Lachlan 'chief' at 33°04'08.7""S 146°47'20.5""E, a site termed 'King's Grave' by the NSW Office of Environment & Heritage.

The Dick and Lindsay Roughsey Collection comprises a cylindrical, wooden, message stick with a pointed lower end and a tuft of emu feathers bound with red fibre string. The surface of the message stick, painted by Mornington Island artists and brothers Dick and Lindsay Roughsey, is covered with goodwill symbols painted in black, yellow, red and white in geometric designs and lines, dots and dashes on a white background. It was presented to prominent scholar of Aboriginal studies, Dr F. D. McCarthy, in Canberra in 1972.    Although not universal throughout Aboriginal Australia, message sticks were used by many tribes, including Lardil people, for various reasons including the coordination of large socio-economic events, to summon others for initiation ceremonies, for hostile purposes or to convey messages relating to sickness or death. Traditional message or 'talking' sticks were made of soft wood, ornamented, carved and often painted bright colours, and marked in various ways with notches, dots, strokes, curves and geometric designs. Lardil artists and brothers, Dick (Goobalathaldin) and Lindsay (Burud), Roughsey, were prominent in reviving and preserving the art culture of the Lardil people which has a long history stemming from traditions of body painting and shows strong affinities to ceremonial designs stretching to Central Australia. Beginning with bark painting, inspired by his visits to Arnhem Land in the 1950s, Dick Roughsey, OBE, went on to become internationally renowned for his children's books and remains one of Australia?s most significant artists. His talented older brother Lindsay, also known as 'Spider', was a source of inspiration to younger artists and at the heart of the history of Lardil painting from the early 1960s until his death in 2007.",Dick and Lindsay Roughsey,1972,terminus ante quem,,2,1,1,46,,,"The message stick is associated with Mornington Island, Queensland, Australia",,,,,,1400,300,100,15;23;5;21,,,4,,4,1985.0209.0001,Dick and Lindsay Roughsey collection  Date received at Australian Institute of Anatomy: 1972,,,National Museum of Australia,-16.5175,139.405889,,http://collectionsearch.nma.gov.au/ce/message%20stick?&object=19628,,,19628,,This is the longest object in the AMSD,4;1,460;461;462;463,

This is mostly in the Ganalbingu linguistic area. However, note that in the SAM register the 'Purchased Tribe' is listed as 'Katji'.     Katji refers to a place and is not an ethnonym. In Peterson, Nicolas. 1976. ""Mortuary customs of Northeast Arnhem Land: An account compiled from Donald Thomson’s fieldnotes.""  Memoirs of the National Museum of Victoria 37:97-108, there is a quotation from a report: ""While at Katji [on the mainland south of Milingimbi] camp in January 1937 Thomson noticed red blazes on the trees along the path to Derby Creek. These were to free the area about the Katji River from a restriction that had been imposed at the death of an important man."". A herpetology report (https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/85b6a616-2ca6-48fb-bddb-317dbaf3a430) gives coordinates for a 'Katji Lagoon' as: -12.35, 134.78, which is near a 'Gatji Rd'. Gatji is also the name of a homeland (https://bushtel.nt.gov.au/profile/507) at -12.273, 134.82.    In the Bawinanga Aboriginal Corporation Annual Report 2016-2017, Gatji is mapped as being in the Wurlaki/Djinang (synonyms) area which also encompasses Ramingining and east to the mouth of the Glyde River.     Thus the best estimation so far is that the cultural owners are in the Wurlaki/Djinang speaking area, but a better consultation of Shepherdson's diaries could place it in the Ganalbingu area   (Chirila: Ganalbingu  Austlang: N83: Ganhalpuyngu  Glottolog: gana1269)",,"Message stick was sent by native men asking for tobacco and calico in exchange for cypress pine trees felled.

Recommended for purchase – data with specimens is very good. —W. Tindale Ethnologist    PK: It's not certain that ""arleedie"" really is the word for message stick. SAM records put things in the description field that are sometimes words for message but can also be referring to the sender or something depicted on the stick. Not sure if Mirniny is really a language that has vowel-initial words either, so the realisation could be something like yalityi or waliti. Note that the Chirila database records 'arlart' as a term for message stick in Alyawarr. This would explain vowel-initial term but Alyawarr is too far away. Note also that aliti is a Pitjantjatjara/Yankunytjatjara term for prickly wattle (Acacia victoriae), so this could conceivably be referring to the species of wood that the object is made of.      PK: AC (of SAM) wrote on 17 August 2021: ""Our database also lists A27213, A27214 and A62052 as restricted material."" In the excel spreadsheet that PK has seen there are no indications that A27213 is restricted. Nor is it clear why A27213 is restricted but A27229 is not since it is the same type of object collected by the same individual from the same area.     AR: A note in the remarks column of SAM register alongside 27213 and 27214 states: ""nn. 'alidi. no message – a passport carried by a native selected to announce a ceremony.

(Note, however, that Mirniny turns up twice in Chirila. One is over on the western edge of the Nullabor near Caiguna. The other is further east near Eucla. The Eucla Mirniny is the one referred to here.)  We have assumed that ""Ooldea tribe"" is (eastern) Mirniny on the basis of the fact that the Ooldea the mission settlement is in this area at 30° 27′ 32.9″ S, 131° 50′ 8.21″ E and Ooldea soak is just north of it at 30°24'29.0""S 131°49'42.0""E.

Because I worked closely with an old lady called Nita Garidjalalug who was born in 1947. Her father's sister also had the same name. She lived 1912-1968 and married somebody from Milingimbi and moved there to be with him. I was not able to confirm if he was called 'Andrew' but it seems he may have been (there are probably some mission records on their marriage). So it looks like it was probably about her and they did work out the marriage arrangement in the end - but this does not really gel with the idea of the message stick being collected 1960's or later, because of the use of ballpoint pen in the note. Could the note have been copied, or traced over, later than the collection date? Would be great to solve the mystery. Unfortunately if the message stick was about the Nita who is still living, there is nobody older than her who is alive, who might remember any marriage proposals (the girl herself is not involved in these), and she did not marry anybody from Milingimbi.""    PK: RS wrote this before PK was able to view the register in person at SAM. The full register detail is now added and it is clear that the message stick was accessioned on 12th April 1954 and that it was a gift and that it was acquired from ""H. A. Norman from the Estate of Mrs W. A. Norman"". It was also evident that the curators had mixed up SAM_A_45825 with SAM_A_45824. This is now corrected in OCCAMS.    R.S. wrote on 27 July: ""Here is the genealogy. I think I am allowed to pass this genealogy on - but I've had it for a long time, received it from a school teacher and have never really talked to people about it much. If you want I can check with community members. The confusing thing about it is that multiple people have had exactly the same name - the same Mawng name and English name. So there are two Nita Garidjalalug's the one who is living and the earlier one who is connected to the message stick. The relevant entry is p.70 of the pdf (original p.45). This Nita Garidjalalug was born 1912-1968 and her skin name was Ngalangila. Her brother Phillip Ambidjambidj is the father of the living Nita Garidjalalug whose skin name is Ngalawmut. The genealogy doesn't mention who she was married to but perhaps Milingimbi records will mention this. The other mentions of Garidjalalug in the Mawng genealogy all seem to refer to the currently living one, which makes sense if she went to Milingimbi got married and stayed there.""

Purchased from a member of the tribe in 1914 by Mr A. H. Lewsey in charge of line camp.""    NOTE: Some questions about this object – if it is a contemporary depiction of the construction of the OLT then it would date to 1870-1872 and held by the community until 1914 when it was sold to Lewsey.     Further, the OLT did not go between Port Augusta and Eucla (as far as I can tell). Note also that the stick appears to depict a railroad rather than a telegraph.     A working hypothesis: H. A. Lewsey was a 'line manager' of the Trans-Australian Railroad between Port Augusta and Eucla, in the period prior to 1914. The railroad was completed in 1917. Alternatively, he was a line manager of a telegraph (not the OLT) constructed or maintained along the railroad between Port Augusta and Eucla.      On 19 July 2022 PK contacted the History Trust of South Australia with the following question:  ""Dear History Trust of South Australia,  In December 1990 you donated a message stick to the South Australian Museum (A-69467). This object was once part of the Pioneer Village Hackham and according to the register the label received with object says ""indicates the five tents of the construction gang. Purchased from a member of the tribe in 1914 by Mr A. H. Lewsey in charge of line camp."" This is a long shot but I was hoping somebody might be able to identify Mr A. H. Lewsey from other sources, and perhaps clarify 'line camp'. Construction of railway line? In what period? If anyone has any expertise I would be very glad to hear it. I am trying to propose a museum exhibition and would like to find out as much as possible about the context. Piers""    On 26 July 2022, Jacinta Koolmatrie replied: ""Hi Piers,      Thanks for getting in touch. I wanted to know what research you had already done before I looked further into this to understand more about what you’re looking for.    Would you be able to let me know what information the South Australian Museum have provided to you and what independent research you have done?       Thanks,  Jacinta.""    On the same date PK replied: ""Thanks Jacinta,  The sum total of my research is as follows:  Consultation of the original hardcopy registers of the South Australian Museum and a search through the museum correspondence. This has yielded only the original accession record dated 18 Feb 1991, which is now attached and relevant detail outlined in pink.  Various search terms in NLA's Trove of 'Lewsey' in combination with regions and details mentioned in this record with no success  Everything I know is thus contained in the details I sent earlier.     If you can point me to an expert, archive or resource that would be fantastic.    Piers ""    On the same day Jacinta replied: ""Hi Piers,    Thanks, that helps to know. I have looked through our registers to see if we ever accessioned it and we didn’t, which leads me to believe we immediately gave it to the South Australian Museum. I have also looked through our database to determine whether we have more donations related to Lewsey and we do not.    I imagine the line camp is referring to the east-west telegraph line seeing as it’s referring to Port Augusta and Eucla. I believe you may be able to get some help through the state library if you haven’t already been in contact with them. They have a lot of material related to the telegraph line that could be useful.     Sorry I wasn’t able to be of more help. Hopefully you are able to get some more context.    Jacinta.""    On 03.08.2022 PK wrote to GS of the National Railway Museum in Port Adelaide:    ""Dear G,   I am a researcher at the University of New England, inquiring into the origin and significance of a message stick at the South Australian Museum. The message stick purportedly depicts a railroad and a rail gang construction camp, and it refers either to the railway line between Port Augusta and Eucla, or a telegraph line between those two settlements. There is only one clue: the museum register says ""Message-stick, inscribed with story 'of the construction of the overland telegraph line between Eucla and Pt Augusta'. Purchased from a member of the tribe in 1914 by Mr A. H. Lewsey in charge of line camp."" The problem is that the Overland Telegraph was completed in the 1870s and it never went between Port Augusta and Eucla. There is also no depiction of a telegraph on the object but there is a depiction of a railroad. Accordingly, A. H. Lewsey may have been in charge of a *railway* 'line camp' in this period. Can you recommend a resource for finding a certain A. H. Lewsey in rail construction or maintenance records from 1914 and prior? Many thanks for any leads.  Piers ""  08.08.2022:  ""Good afternoon Piers,    Thank you for your enquiry. Unfortunately we don't have anything on A. H. Lewsey here, if he was employed by the railways though you could check with the State Records of South Australia as they have the personnel records.

Māgaya is the peace, order and good government afforded the people constitutionally under Customary Law in a manner similar to the Australian Constitution as stated in section 5l.  The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of the Northern Territory is seen as breaking these fundamental constitutional responsibilities placed upon the Parliament.

Bastian writes: ""Rein zufällig war jedenfalls die Beobachtung, soweit sie mich angeht. Durch einen Zufall gewissermaassen gelangte ich nach Cooktown, durch einen Zufall wurde ich einige Tage dort aufgehalten, und durch einen Zufall wieder kam ich mit einem der dortigen Bewohner in ein Gespräch, in dessen Laufe ich durch eine zufällige Neben-[240]-bemerkung aufmerksam wurde und zum Weiterfragen veranlasste. Zuesrt hörte ich in Gesellschaft mit Hrn. St. Georges, dem Police-Magistrate, und einem alten Colonisten, dem Australien seine zweite Heimath geworden war, von dem ausgedehnten System von Signale sprechen, wodurch sich die australischen Stämme (besonders am Dawson) auf weite Entfernung hin verständlich zu machen wüssten, von den in Bäumen eingeschnitzten Zeichen (ähnlich den in Höhlen angetroffenen  Malereien), von Verzierungsformen u. dergl., und dann wurden auch einander zugeschickte Briefe erwähnt. Ich hielt dies mehr für eine Facon de parler und konnte an demselben Abend, wo ich von einer Erkundigung auf die andere geführt wurde, nicht wieder darauf zurückkommen. Am nächsten Morgen traf ich mit einem Sergeanten der sog. Black Police (gleich den meisten Offizieren dieses trefflich organisierten Corps über die Eingebornen wohlunterrichtet) zusammen, und als ich das Gespräch auf denselben Gegenstand brachte, erhielt ich zu meiner Verwunderung  nicht die halb und halb erwartete Widerlegung, sondern eine Bestätigung. Genauere Erklärungen, auf welche ich jetzt einzugehen suchte, konnte mein Gewährsmann mir leider nicht geben, versprach mir jedoch bei einem seiner Leute, der mit allem Dahingehörigen gut bekannt sei, als Dolmetscher zu deinen, sobald er aus der Station nach der Stadt kommen würde. Hier war ein Dilemma. Die Station war ziemlich entfernt, der Dampfer, den ich bei meinem genau berechneten Reiseplan nicht versäumen durfte, war bereits eingelaufen und konnte jeden Augenblick zur Wiederabfahrt fertig sein. Dabei war ich durch das Verpacken einiger am Platze erlangter Sammlungsgegenstände beansprucht und auch noch durch andere Besorgungen. Ein freier Moment musste indess geschaffen werden, worin ich mich nach dem in der Vorstadt gelegenen Polizeiposten begab und dort einen schwarzen Unteroffizier ausfindig machte, der zu den Intelligenteren seines Gleichen gehörte. Freilich war sein specifisch-australisches Pidgeon-English mit so vielen technischen Wendungen durchwebt, dass das Verständniss allerei Hin- und Herfragen erforderte. Damit gingen viele Minuten verloren, und doch andere, bis richtig aufgefasst war, was ich eigentlich wolle, dann war das Holz zu beschaffen (und zwar die für Kerben geeignete Art), dann ein Messer, was, wie immer in solchen Fällen (wenn es auf Eile ankommt), gerade nicht bei der Hand war, darauf der Brief zu schreiben oder zu schneiden, ferner zu erklären – und für das Ganze blieb mir kaum eine halbe Stunde. Ich fühlte mich deshalb von dem Resultat auch im Grunde nur wenig befriedigt, und unzufrieden mit mir selbst, da über mehrere der Cautelen, die gerade bei einer Untersuchung so hochwichtiger Art auf das Strengste hätten festgehalten werden müssen, allzu leicht fortgeschlüpft war, von dem Ticken der Taschenuhr gedrängt. Indess, wie die Sachen lagen, mussten sie gelassen werden, und mir blieb nichts übrig, als mich einzuschiffen.""",1;4;3,195;1264;1265;1266;1267;1268;1269;1270,

The “cm lang” is part of the description of the message stick (29,5cm long). The “Australien” may be the extension of the column to the right (vertical circle). Concerning the right circle I’d say the first word starts with a capital G and I would bet it continues over the next line because the next word starts with what looks like an h or f. There are not many German words this length starting with an h or f. It does look like “Gef-hart…horn” but that’s not even a word. I’ts very likely the passage end with “Carl Sahl in Sidney” but to be honest, without your hint I wouldn’t have read “Carl” because the ending is that blurry. What’s really interesting is the modern, not Sütterlin e in Sidney.     I can’t really make sense of the writing in the horizontal circle to the left containing W. Australia but noticed some oddities there as well. The hand writing looks different from the rest. First of all it’s written in pencil instead of ink. And the capital A looks different and a lot newer. It’s possible this was written later and by a different person. The numbers following the “W. Australien” look like this person referenced a different section or message stick. If you have the corresponding files “2582 u[nd] 2233/36” they might give you a hint on what the author tried to reference. And he had a terrible handwriting, that’s for sure.""    Piers replied: ""Thanks Anneke,   This is really useful. I had incorrectly guessed that ""cm lang"" was ""sammlung""!    The crossreferences to other artefacts aren't usually helpful. Often they are preceded by ""dgl."" which stands for dergleichen and the comparison is usually on the basis of visual similarities rather than origins.    My bad guess for the words preceding W.Australien was something like ""dorf__ W. Australien"". There are very few settlements in the north west of Western Australia, where I suspect the artefact comes from, but the word doesn't like any village I know from that area. (In fact, I lived in that region for three years.)    Thanks again for taking the time with this,  Piers""    Anneke replied: ""“Dorf” could be possible but the first letter is a little too small to pass for a capital D. Plus, the capital W and A are not written in Sütterlin style. Therefore it seems likely the author would have written a modern D as well. Yet again, this is just a wild guess. Said letter could also be “v” followed by “o” and… something “h”-ish. Maybe “f” but “h” seems more likely because the lower… how do you call that? Anyway, the lower part of the letter is not strait but bent.    In writing that I just realized the next word is most certainly “sicher”. What I first thought was “u” looks more like “i” followed by “c”. That would make “…h sicher W[est] Australien”. Does that make any sense?    And a minor addition to the part on the right (it seems I’m having way too much fun deciphering this): if the first two lines are still written in Sütterlin, the first word on the second line could be “herrn”. That would make “Ge…- herrn Carl Sahl in Sidney”. Again, all the letters in Sahl and Sidney look much more modern than the rest, so the two words in the beginning could contain a mixture of old and new letters. Anyway, I doubt that whatever is written there contains a specific location.    I hope that helps. If you come across another illegible passage, feel free to ask me!

After I have made careful drawings of them for future use. I have not yet found one instance where the marks upon them convey any meaning by the blacks from which [insert] whom [end insert] they have been obtained. They say the marks are only for ornament and that the stick"" is more of a token to accredit the messenger. This does not disprove the positive statements made eg by Mr Dawson that in some places the marks have a meaning. So far I cannot find an instance either in South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales or Victoria. Message sticks were not known to or used by the Kurnai. The messenger sometimes carried a boomerang, shield or spear as a token from the sender of the message.' It is therefore possible that these message sticks came from Howitt to Tylor.    Letter 4: I must now explain the delay in procuring for you the humming instrument and the fire stick which you expressed a desire to obtain. I have now one tundun (Gippsland) one Bribbun (Queensland) and I expect shortly several others. [2] It is not however easy to procure these as the blackfellows dont like to give them up nor tell let white people see them. I have also a fire drilling apparatus from Queensland; I shall shortly have one belonging to the district and I am promised another from southern Queensland. I hope also to procure others. So soon as I obtain those or others, or find that the delay will be too long I shall send the collection off to you with further particulars.

It just says message stick. It looks like a cigar. Nora Pearce and June Simmons.’ Curatorial note: ‘Message stick, Australia. There was much discussion amongst anthropologists in the late nineteenth century about the use of message sticks in different parts of Australia. It was thought that they were widely used and would have served a range of functions such as signifiers of safe passage through new territories or as invitations. It has been suggested that the notches on the stick probably acted as reminders rather than as a language that could be read. Today they stand as an icon of Australian Aboriginal culture. This particular message stick was found with the donor's father and grandfather's papers after their deaths and little is known of its provenance or use.

And are not known from the Richmond River District.    Updated description from RMV:  ""Briefstokje uit één stuk geelkleurig hout gesneden dat met rode kleurstof is bedekt. Versierd met parallelsgewijs ingesneden verticale groeven en dwarsgroeven die elkaar kruisen. De ingesneden figuren hebben hun betekenis, men brengt daardoor bepaalde mededelingen over.    A short stick of light coloured wood with a series of short, narrow grooves or notches, 'V'-shaped in section, cut along the sides giving the piece of wood a quadrangular cross section. These cuts are reminiscent of 'tally grooves', and of the series of short grooves found on rock engraving sites in the Grafton district of the Clarence valley, and in north-eastern South Australia. Such rock engravings are not found in the Richmond River district. The longer grooves on the message sticks are cut on nopposed sides (nineteen on one, twenty on the other) as are also the shorter grooves (fourteen on one side, thirteen on the other). The message stick measures 9.9 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm.    The pair of message sticks is a unique specimen. No other examples from this area are known, and there is only one reference to their use in the local literature. Bray (1923:7) mentions that 'messages from tribe to tribe were carried verbally except very important ones. This [sic] were marked on a stick by means of notches'. To the south we have records of their use at Port Stephens (Scott 1929:33-4), but unfortunately no description of their features. To the north in Queensland such stick were used, and there are surviving examples in the Queensland Museum's collections. Some of these bear notches, as do the Richmond River specimens, though the particular examples do not come from south-east Queensland (see Hamlyn-Harris 1918:19, 20, 26, 27). Such message sticks apparently served a double purpose; they were 'memory sticks' for the bearer, and guarantees of his good faith as he travelled through the territory of different tribal groups. There seems to be little information on their use in eastern New South Wales, though they are reasonably well documented for other areas such as the Darling basin and central Australi (Hamlyn-Harris 1918; Howitt 1904:678-710).""

I also acknowledge the loss for the King’s families as he becomes a leader for his people. I look to this appointment with hope that there may be more robust advocacy for First Nations people and strong commitment to reconciliation and a pathway for treaties.  In 2018 I was honoured to meet with the King on Yolngu country and handed him a letter stick which I have here in this parliament. It said: We declare that we have not been conquered. We declare that to this day we are sovereign people. We declare that we are subject to our Madayin system of law constituted by the unseen creator the universe and revealed to the givers of law, djangawu and barama. We continue to steward this system through our lawful authorities and government.  A Madayin system of law establishes magayamirr peace, order and good government is dhapirrk consistent in its statues, and is assented to by all Yolngu citizens through the wana lupthun ceremony.  On our Madayin system of law is guided by the Yolngu yothu yindi separation of powers. Our Madayin system of law is rule of law, not a rule of man. Our Madayin system of law is equal to any other system of law, provided with this was an explanation of the letter stick which read, ‘A letter stick is traditionally used to deliver a message by intermediaries across long distances. It uses symbolic references to carry the intent of the leaders and senders communication.’ Letter sticks were often of hand size and made of wood and incisions or burnt marks. This letter stick is earth pigments of incised wood. The letter stick is one of four. It has a message to the parliament of Australia from the Yolngu nations, and more broadly, the people of north east Arnhem Land.  On the right hand side of the letter stick the symbols for ngarra parliament and the two Yolngu pillars of society, dhuwa and yirritja combined to speak of the Yolngu parliaments. This is then juxtaposed with another system of ngarra parliament and etchings of six states and two Territories of the Australian nation. These symbols combined to speak of the parliaments of Australia jurisdiction. The subsequent message is one of the Yolngu nations outlining the equal standing of our ngarra institution compared to Australian parliaments. It is a declaration of ongoing Yolngu sovereignty while also being a diplomatic gesture of intent and also invitation to work toward a place of mutual acceptance between Yolngu and Australian jurisdictions.  I gave this letter stick to the then Prince and asked if he would deliver it to the Prime Minister of Australia. I asked him, ‘On behalf of the people standing before you and the Yolngu nations that you intervene on our behalf and take the strong position to acknowledge our sovereignty and promote a pathway to treaty’. I do not know what happened to the letter stick, and I am uncertain whether it got to Canberra, but Prince Charles accepted it on that day, and now we must look to the future and work towards righting the wrongs of the past.  The grave violations caused by colonisation continue until today. But there is opportunity now to work towards genuine reconciliation. For the first time, there is government intention at all levels of government to create treaties with First Nations people, treaties that respect and do not extinguish our sovereign status. I am hopeful that, with hard work, this can be achieved.  From the first day of the British invasion of this country, First Nations people have never been afforded the dignity or the treaty-making process. We are the only nation in the Commonwealth to be treated with such disrespect. Many of our people have died and continue to die fighting for our people, our county and culture.""

So if the location is correct I'm guessing the objects were collected later, perhaps when Hill government entomologist. The Royal Botanical Gardens Victoria lists specimens collected in that area in 1913, eg this one: https://avh.ala.org.au/occurrences/4c2777b2-3b5a-4ae6-88bc-b7302975c779    A text to review would be Strong, Bruce W. 2016. Gerald Freer Hill (1880-1954). Deniliquin: Deniliquin Newspapers.    David Nash contacted Bruce Strong about this on 21 June 2020. Strong replied: ""Piers is correct - the 1911 expedition were a fair distance from Adelaide River. If it was collected by Hill, in 1911, and if the origin of the items was Adelaide River, then they must have been traded/travelled from there. However, I would have thought that Hill would have mentioned them in his diary and I’m pretty sure I would have noted that. It is far more likely that Hill collected them while Economic Botanist in Darwin."" He also attached an excel spreadsheet with metadata for item X25839 as follows:     Accession Lot: (Collection Details): [X 25839] Hill, Mr Gerald Freer (Purchase)    Collection Name: (Collection Details): G.F. Hill Collection    Object/Medium: (Object Details): Ornament, unidentified; Message stick  Object Description: A band made of glass beads possibly strung on European cotton/linen thread.

State/Province: (Locality Details): Northern Territory  Specific Locality: (Locality Details): Darwin  Circa: (Collection Details): 1918  Accession Date: (Accession Details): 17 Dec 1918    Nash subsequently wrote: ""Well spotted Bruce.  Accession by purchase in 1918... when did he first travel to Melbourne  after the 1911 expedition?    And I note that at the end of that expedition he took the train from  Pine Creek to Darwin 15-17 April 1912, so would have had a chance to  pick up something at Adelaide RIver?  David""    Strong replied: ""According to his own account he ""arrived in Melbourne in June or July, 1912…”. In a memo of his dated 23 October 1912 he noted that he had virtually finished processing all specimens. [Regarding Nash's query re journey from Pine Creek to Darwin] Possibly.  According to a Departmental memo written late August 1912 ”...natural history specimens [I assume this includes those of Aborigial origins?] …left by Mr. Hill with Professor Spencer when Mr. Hill went to Hong Kong three months ago.”  My gut feeling is that X25838 was collected while Hill was Entomologist.

1018,,Description of Woiwurrung message stick communication,72,"From Brough Smythe, R. 1878. The Aborigines of Victoria: With notes relating to the habits of natives of other parts of Australia and Tasmania. Vol. I. Melbourne & London: John Ferres. p133:     ""When a [unspecified Victorian] tribe is encamped, it is not permitted to any other tribe to approach the camp without warning. Bent on revenge, or with an intent to murder, or for the purpose of stealing a young woman, a warrior will sometimes invade a camp in the night and seek to effect his purpose, but such enterprizes are not of very common occurrence. Whether for friendly intercourse or for war, the tribe which seeks a meeting must give notice of its coming in due form. A messenger (We-ar-garr), whose duty it is to proceed to the camp and state the intentions of the visitors, or to invite them to come to the camp of his tribe, is formally appointed by the principal man of the tribe, assisted by the old men in council. The young men are not allowed, under any circumstances, to take part in such deliberations as may be preliminary to so important a matter as a visit to or the reception of another tribe. On very solemn occasions two ambassadors or messengers are appointed; ordinarily, only one. The messenger has to carry a token, by virtue of which he passes safely through the lands of the several tribes. The token is a piece of wood, eight or ten inches in length, sometimes round and sometimes flat, and seldom more than one inch in thickness. On it are inscribed hieroglyphics which can be read and interpreted, and which notify all persons of the nature of the mission. If the mission is a friendly one, the stick is streaked mostly with red-ochre (Werrup); but if unfriendly, or for the purpose of demanding satisfaction for injuries done, or for war, then it is mostly streaked with white-ochre (Ngarrimbul). The principal man, in putting this stick into the hands of the messenger, and having named the tribe for which the invitation is intended, says, “You hold this now” (Koong-ak kinee Mirrambinerr). “Look out and find plenty of blackfellows” (Yane-wat benjer oonee kolen). “You tell all blackfellows to come here” (Toombooni boole-anin kolen-yan-an niool or Tom-buk U-mar-ko Koolin Ner-lin-go).""",,1878,terminus ante quem,,4,,,2,,,"On 30 August 2018, Barry Blake wrote to Piers Kelly: ""The language is the language of the Melbourne area, which I was calling Woiwurrung.

The stick may have come from from any of the WA areas he explored, and dates.... who knows.  I found the stick amongst my father's effects while he was very ill and close to death. I asked him about it but he couldn't even remember that he had it. I have bull roarers and boomerangs that Wells left to my dad. He had been given them by various Aboriginal people- probably in WA, though he did explore in SA until he was 73.    My wife and I have lived and worked with Aboriginal people for over 40 years in the NT. When I showed the stick to some of the Tennant Creek men they did not respond much. They would have told me had they any knowledge of such an object. We likewise have been given a plethora of artefacts from the Tennant Creek/Barkly Tableland region.    I have tried looking on the WWW for images of similar things but only found much cruder message sticks and so that is why I contacted you.    Thank you for responding to my email.    best wishes""    Piers Kelly replied: ""Hi Richard,  How very interesting. I would say your great grandfather's message stick is plausibly from WA. It looks like others that I've seen from Western Australia at the Ethnologisches Museum in Berlin and at the National Museum of Australia. In a quick search of the database I've found this polished sandalwood style as far north Roebourne and as far south as Rottnest Island.     You will notice that this one (on the far right) from the British Museum is very similar and it's from the Murchison district: http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=505450&partId=1&searchText=message+stick&images=true&page=1    I can give you access to the message sticks database-in-progress if you like, but it still needs a lot of tidying up. Just let me know and I'll generate log-in details.    Would it be possible for me to include your artefact in the database too? It's certainly a fine piece of work, and other experts might have more to say about it than me.     All the best,    Piers  P.S. Do you remember which university researchers you contacted in WA?

Zum Teil sind die Zeichnungen der Tjurunga und Schwirrhölzer auch mit Nummern versehen, deren Zuordnung jedoch unklar bleibt. Sie können weder mit den Original-Objekt- nummern von Hermann Klaatsch, die teilweise noch auf den von ihm gesammelten Objekten erhalten sind, noch mit den Objekt- nummern in der Klaatschsammlung des Rautenstrauch-Joest- Museums in Übereinstimmung gebracht werden. Es liegen Zeichnungen oder Pausen von elf Tjurunga bzw. Schwirrhölzern mit Nummern sowie Zeichnungen oder Pausen von fünf Tjurunga bzw.  Schwirrhölzern ohne Nummern vor (zum Teilin zwei Hälften sowie Vorder- und Rückseite gesondert gezeichnet).  Neben den Tjurunga- und Schwirrholzmustern gibt es auch zwei sehr ausdifferenzierte Muster von länglichen Objekten, die wegen der vielfältigen enthaltenen Informationen aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach Botenstäbe darstellen. Eine angedeutete Schnur, befestigt an einem Ende des länglichen Stabes, weist jedoch auch auf eine Nutzung als Schwirrholz hin. Während eines der Botenstabmuster lediglich geometrische Längs- und Querschnitte aufweist, ist das andere mit geometrischen Schnitten und einer figürlichen Darstellung versehen. Ausführliche Erläuterungen am Rand der Zeichnung erklären die Striche oder Schnitte auf dem Holz als kalendarische Angaben (Tage, Monate, Mond) und verweisen außerdem auf drei Stämme, die gemeinsam einen Corroboree abhalten. Die figürliche Darstellung ist „The strange king"" betitelt.  Wie weitere Notizen auf diesen (zweiteiligen) Blättern belegen, wurde dieser Botenstab in Daly River (im westlichen Arnhem Land, Nordterritorium) von einem Mitglied des ,,Mullock Mullock Tribe” angefertigt. Dem anderen Botenstabmuster sind zwar auch ergänzenden Erläuterungen hinzugefügt, es existiert aber keine Herkunftsangabe.  Wie mehrfache Erwähnungen von Botenstäben in den Briefen an Schoetensack belegen, war Klaatsch an dem Phänomen dieser einfachen Nachrichtenübermittlung sehr interessiert. [fn:61: So z.B. in Brief Nr.14 und Brief Nr. 33 von Klaatsch an Schoetensack, PHK] Auch zeichnete er die Anordnung der Einritzungen in einem Brief an seinen Heidelberger Freund auf. Allerdings zeigte er sich enttäuscht von der profanen Bedeutung der Zeichen: Die diagonalen Striche in die eine Richtung bedeuteten nichts anderes als ,,Unser ,tribe’ kommt in dieser Richtung” und diagonale Striche in die gegenläfige Richtung ,,Euer ,tribe’ soll aus der anderen Richtung kommen”; die aus diesen aufeinander zulaufendedn diagonalen Strichen zusammengesetzen Winkel bedeuteten: ,,Dann wollen wir uns treffen und zusammen Corroboree abhalten”. Klaatschs ernuuchterter Kommentar dazu lautet: ,,Ich hatte mehr complicirte Dinge erwartet und erhofft, werde meine Studien fortsetzen”[fn:62: Brief Nr. 14, S.25, von Klaatsch an Schoetensack vom 5.-15 Oktober 1904, Telegraphenstation Floraville bei Burketown, PHK]"" p38    In Erckenbrecht, Corinna. 2010. Auf der Suche den Ursprüngen: Die Australienreise des Anthropologen und Sammlers Hermann Klaatsch 1904-1907. Cologne: Gesellschaft für Völkerkunde, Verein zur Förderung des Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museums der Stadt Köln.    JB Translation: ""Klaatsch copied or traced the patterns of sacred objects (tjurunga and bullroarers) as well as the patterns of message sticks, or he made impressions of them with soft vegetable fiber. Partly the drawings of tjurunga and bullroarers are also accompanied with numbers, their assignment remains unclear. They can be matched neither with the original object numbers of Hermann Klaatsch, some of which are still preserved on the objects he has collected, nor with the object numbers in the Klaatsch collection of the Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum. There are drawings or traced sketches of eleven tjurunga or bullroarers with numbers, as well as drawings or traced sketches of five tjurunga and bullroarers without numbers (drawn separately to split two halves as well as front and back).  In addition to the tjurunga and bullroarers, there are also two very differentiated patterns of elongated objects. They most probably depict message sticks because they contain diverse information. However, an implied string attached to one end of the elongated stick, also indicates it being used as a bullroarer. While one of the message stick’s patterns has only geometric longitudinal and cross sections, the other one has geometric sections and a figurative depiction.  Detailed explanations at the edge of the drawing claim the lines or cuts on the wood to be calendar data (days, months, moon), and also refer to three tribes that hold a corroboree together. The figurative depiction is titled ""The strange king”. According to the further notes on these (two-part) pages, this message stick was made in Daly River (in western Arnhem Land, Northern Territory) by a member of the ""Mullock Mullock Tribe"". Although the patterns on the other message stick were also accompanied with explanations, there is no indication of origin.  According to several references to message sticks in the letters to Schoetensac, Klaatsch was very interested in the phenomenon of this simple communication. [fn:61: So z.B. in Brief Nr.14 und Brief Nr. 33 von Klaatsch an Schoetensack, PHK] He also sketched the arrangement of the carvings in a letter to his friend Heidelberg.  However, he was disappointed by the mundane meaning of the signs: the diagonal strokes in one direction mean nothing other than “our tribe comes in that direction”, and diagonal strokes in the opposite direction mean “your tribe should come from another direction”; the angles composed of these diagonal lines mean: ""Then we want to meet and hold Corroboree together."" Klaatsch's commentary is: ""I had expected more complicated things and hoped I to continue my studies”.

Message sticks from Arnhem Land have vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines, diamond patterns and so on; with human figures; like those from western Arnhem Land, most refer specifically to economic transactions, and are accompanied by verbal messages. Ceremonial message sticks, in contrast, are distinctively shaped, bearing sacred designs, or take the form of raugga emblems, sometimes hung with feathered pendants, and sometimes made of ward beeswax.

Murray Garde (2014, 104-105) wrote: ""Using a ‘big placename’ to refer to an outstation can in some contexts create confusion when such big names have also become designations for other focal sites in the ‘estate’. An example of this involves the kun-bolkngeykimuk or ‘big placename’ of Kubumi, which was used to refer to an outstation on the Mann River established in the early 1980s by people of the Kulmarru clan. The kun-bolkngeyyahwurd or ‘small placename’ for the location of the outstation is Yikarrakkal. The focal place for Kubumi is a stretch of the Mann River where the river widens and white sandy banks are a popular camping place for people from the outstation, which is located only a kilometre upstream to the south. In the period of 1990 to 1997 when I lived at Yikarrakkal, movement between the outstation and the river camp was constant. With both the outstation and the river camp both being referred to by the name Kubumi, it became very difficult to disambiguate reference to these two places when speaking to people who did not live at Yikarrakkal. In 1990 the community decided to deal with this confusion by using the kun-bolkngeyyahwurd of Yikarrakkal for the outstation and the kun-bolkngeykimuk Kubumi, for the river camp. Kuninjku people in the Mann River region will refer to the outstation as either Yikarrakkal or Kubumi depending on their assessment of shared knowledge with interlocutors. ‘Big names’ are more widely known outside of the local sphere of interaction.""

In Indigenous and minority placenames: Australian and international perspectives, edited by Ian D Clark, Luise Hercus and Laura Kostanski, 97-121.

""Two Mengerrdji youths singing at the Gaagudju camp at Oenpelli during their travels prior to initiation ceremonies. East Alligagor River, 2 July 1912.  July 2nd  Late yesterday evening we were sitting in our mosquito-proof tent … when we heard a special singing, coming from the direction of the native camp. It was repeated again in the morning, when we found that the singing came from two youths who were standing close together facing one another, each of them leaning on a wand, coloured red and white. The song they sang was:  ‘Kadimanga,  Da laian a.  Da laian a.  Kadimanga,  Da laian a,  Da laian a.’  It was repeated time after time, and always the women, sitting in camp, replied with the refrain, ‘Wait Ba! Wait Ba!’’ repeated as often as they could without drawing breath. They sometimes do this fourteen or fifteen times. I often heard it thirteen, and naturally it dies away towards the close when their breath is exhausted. It is sung on a high note; the Wait is short, the Ba emphasised and prolonged. For days after the boys have come to the men’s camp they stand up every now and then and chant their song and, time after time, from camps, some so far away that you can only just hear the sound, comes back the refrain ‘Wait Ba! Wait Ba!’ it is one of the most picturesque of their songs, especially when heard in the bush at night time.""[fn:21:Spencer, Wanderings in wild Australia pp.765-6]    The above information is reproduced in the 2008 Batty, Allen Morton volume, who include some editorial observations:    [Eds wrote]: Every Gaagudju man has to go through five initiation ceremonial stages during his lifetime. The first ceremony marks the point where a youth leaves the company of women and children and is accepted as a man, the final when he is an old man.  The two Mengerrdji youths photgraphed here were visiting the Gaagudju camp at Oenpelli during a tour prior to their beginning the second stage of initiation. The wands they carry were instruments of safe passage from one part of the country to another, made by themselves under the supervision of the elders. p151    The image also appears in Mulvaney, John, ed. 1982.

Nipper eagerly volunteered to decipher it. Oomagun smiled broadly; he was now to have his turn in the headlines.  The markings on this stick told that Whisky (I use their [181] white-feller names where they have one, as the aboriginal name may be confusing) advised the conspirators to leave the man alone. But Donkey (a powerful man) insisted that Worachi was very strong and he was going to kill him. (The killer believes that he absorbs some of the strength and cunning of the slain man, should he eat portions of his kidney fat.) Jack, for the same reason that moved Donkey, also wished to kill Worachi. But George prevented him at the critical moment. Three men, Moby, Wornerun and Ardgat warned the now hunted W orachi that the killers were close on his heels, and ad- vised him to hide in Parrywarri Creek. He did so. Eventually, reconciliation took place and Worachi re- turned to camp. Later, he was treacherously slain, just as told by Oombali and the witnesses. Grace's Knob, and the place where Worachi was killed, were marked on the stick.  The reverse side of the stick told that the slayers and their associates (Oomagun, Donkey, Marmadu, Dun- gat and Oombali) were now threatened by Worachi's tribal relations, who threatened to come from their camp at Turkey Creek (East Kimberley) and attack them. The marks of these coming avengers, the locality where Jack first attempted to kill Worachi, and other localities were also given. Yet another stick, an old message this, gave details of two previous killings by Oomagun of a man and a woman, in which killings Big Paddy, Duncan and Donkey were implicated. Unfortunately the animals were packed and the troops were moving off before I could jot down all the markings on this stick. It was a slow job, to draw the stick on paper, get the certain interpretation of each mark,and jot it down mark after mark"" 182    Transcript of 20210213-Invaluable-H3247-L242175187.jpg: ""Tracker Bull Bul's message stick to me.

I am gradually getting everything out of my head onto ‘paper’ but ……  Please stay in touch about this.  Kind Regards    John      John W Harris""    John Harris's attached notes (sent to PK on 28 August 2021): THE STORY OF THE MESSAGE STICK – John Harris’s notes    (This is the draft story so far.  More information will be provided in due course)    1) Sometime in 1949 or 1950, a message stick was carved at Ngukurr (then the Roper River Mission).  The stick was to advise Mara people at Borroloola about a ceremony 2 ½ months later at Bing Bong.  Yulki Nungumajbarr says she saw the stick when she was a small girl. Kevin Rogers says that he also saw the stick when his grandfather showed it to his father.  Remarkably,Kevin related this information to me BEFORE the message stick reappeared in August 2008, not having seen it for 60 years or known that it still existed. We published his recollections in our Ngukurr book We Are Aboriginal before the stick resurfaced. I think this stick is remembered because it was the ‘last stick’ and associated with a memorable and significant ceremony.    2) The ceremony was the final part of a funeral ceremony for an old man who had died at Limnen River. He was a Mara man .  He was Gordon Forrest’s father. (I am yet to find out his exact relationship to the other people in this story!)    3) The exact purpose of the stick was to advise people from Borroloola to meet some Ngukurr people at Bing Bong for the ceremony.  The messenger who carried the stick gave the stick to Simon at Borroloola. Simon was a Mara man. Simon did not use a surname.  Simon’s descendants use Simon as a surname.    4) Three canoes went from Ngukurr to Bing Bong.  The people in the canoes were related to Simon.  Yulki’s mother, Bessie, was sister to Queenie, Simon’s wife, (Bessie is very old but still living – died since I wrote that). Kevin Roger’s father, Roger, was also a brother-in-law of Simon.  Canoe 1: Reuben Nunggumajbarr.  Yulki was in this canoe.  Canoe 2: Calico (Henry Nunggumajbarr’s                    father)  Canoe 3: Roger.  (Kevin Roger’s father).    5) The 3 canoes went down the Roper River, then south down the gulf, sleeping for a day or two at different places – Roper Mouth, Limnen River, Rosie Creek, Central Island, Macarthur River. (Must find traditional names for all these places) (“We ate turtle and fish and lilies all the way.”)      6) They then went to Bing Bong where they met Simon and his people for the ceremonies which lasted for two weeks on the waxing moon until full moon.  The remains of the dead man from the previous year were wrapped in paper bark.  Yulki and Roger say this was the last paper-bark coffin they have seen (but this does not necessarily mean it was the last such burial in the region.)    7) After the ceremony was finished the three canoes went to Borroloola for a few days.  Then they returned to Ngukurr by the same route they had followed on the way down.    8)  About 1960, ten years after the ceremony, Simon gave the message stick to Max Field, in Borroloola.  As Max says, Simon gave it to him ‘because he was my mate and he thought I might like it.’  Max did not enquire much about the stick at the time, not being particularly interested ‘in that kind of thing’ as he said to me – he simply put it in a safe place.  Max remains a close friend of Simon’s family.    9) In August 2008, Max Field attended the Ngukurr Centenary.  He brought the stick with him and to show me and asked if I could interpret the stick.  I could partly interpret it (I have a similar stick given to my father.  My father had once had several sticks and explained about how to read them. Message sticks are not complicated. They are to authenticate the bearer and also to function as an aide memoir. Thy contain very basic essential information but bearer knows the full story.)      10)Max Field gave the stick to me for safe keeping and to ascertain its value as an artifact of interest to a museum, preferably an Australian museum.    11) This is my ‘reading’ of the stick.  One face of the stick (‘front’) says that a large number of people will travel by canoe.  The ‘top’ face is a calendar which says that the ceremony will take place following two full moons on the next rising (waxing) moon after that, up until the next full moon.  The face opposite the canoe  (‘back’) face  is authenticating marks – clan marks? – but the simpler marks on the underside (‘bottom’) may be decorative only.  The stick was both a passport and an aide-memoire, its full meaning known to the bearer. The timing of the ceremony is the most crucial information which the bearer may need to check precisely)    12) Those who saw the stick in 1949 say they have never seen one since.  They say it is the ‘last stick’.  Those people who saw the stick for the first time at Ngukurr in August 2008 were extremely interested. They all say they had never seen one before at all.     John Harris wrote on 30 August: ""Dear Piers,  I am glad someone is interested in the stick. It is definitely at the NMA and I will find out how it has been accessioned.  The part of the story you don’t know is that Max Field, to whom Simon gave the stick in Borroloola, had terminal cancer when he showed me the stick at Ngukurr in 2009. He asked me if I could read it and was delighted I could because he basically knew its story and I confirmed it. But his reason for showing me was really otherwise. Eventually he got around to asking me if I thought it had any value. I agreed to find out.  I approached Michael Pickering who was head of Indigenous whatever at NMA at the time. He suggested Wally Caruana for an independent valuation. In due course, we agreed on a price, Wally waived his valuation fee and  I sold it to NMA on behalf of Max Field. The price was quite enough buy a good bed and to provide palliative care for Max Field before he passed away not long afterwards.  So this stick has a long and interesting journey and has only come to light because Max heard I would be at Ngukurr and drove up from Borroloola to find me. Otherwise it would, I suspect, have  simply disappeared, thrown out probably with other junk in his drawer where it had been for 50 years.  Below this email are some not-very-good photos. They are approximately the actual size of the stick.  I have some photos somewhere of most of the participants in the story of the stick. Possibly even Simon if I can find it.  Cheers  John""    John Harris forwarded the following email: ""From: John Harris <jwharris@bible.org.au>  Subject: message stick  Date: 27 January 2009 at 5:51:34 pm AEDT  To: ""wallycaruana@optusnet.com.au"" <wallycaruana@optusnet.com.au>       Dear Wally,     I’m John Harris and your name was given to me by Michael Pickering at the national Museum.  I don’t know if we have met.  Probably not but I am well known in some circles for my writing on Aboriginal history etc.     I am holding a message stick from Eastern Arnhem Land.  It’s little, about 13 cm long and originally painted with ochre which is rubbing off a bit. I attach a couple of photos.  If it belonged to me I would donate it to the museum but it belongs to an old chap – a whitefella like me – who is very old, very sick and very broke.  So I guess I should try and get him something for it.  His name is Max Field and he is currently undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.     The quite amazing thing about this message stick is that I have been able to reconstruct its story.     An old Aboriginal man - Simon - gave it to Max in Borroloola about 1960 because ‘he was a mate and he thought he might like it’.  Max at the time was not interested much in its story or anything, accepted it as a gift but he asked no questions.     Last August I attended the centenary of the Ngukurr (Roper River) community.  I had helped them write a book and photographic record of their history.  In that book one of the Ngukurr elders, Kevin Joshua, wrote that he had only once ever seen a real message stick when he was a small boy ie 1950 or so.  His father had showed it to him and read it to him.  He said it was the last message stick he had ever seen.     Well this is turning into a long story but Max Field decided to attend the centenary celebrations in Ngukurr and drove from Borroloola.  Trying to work out what would happen to his effects, he thought of the message stick. He had heard I was going to be there at Ngukurr and thought that if anyone could read it maybe I could.   I had never actually met him before but he knew of me.  Anyway he showed me this stick and asked me what it meant.  I could partly read it.  Sticks of course never have the full story, not away from the bearer, functioning as an aide memoire and a kind of passport.  It referred to a ceremony that people would travel to by canoe and gave a calendar and clan markings.  As I was trying to read the stick, someone with a video camera asked me if they could video me and the stick.  Thus the event became a little public and people took notice.  An elderly woman, Yulki Nungumajbarr, overheard me and came up to us.       ‘I was on that canoe trip’, she said.  “My family went with a lot of other people to Borroloola for a ceremony when I was a little girl.  It took us a few weeks to get there, eating turtles and fish and water lilies.’     Well we worked out a lot more things but to cut a long story short, this message stick was sent from Ngukurr to Borroloola about 1950 to plan a ceremony.  It is the last message stick ever to have been seen by these people,  as they say none have been carved or used since.  It is actually the last real message stick of this region.  And remarkably it has come back to where it came from!     Wally, I have no idea of its value, indeed I did not consider whether or not it had a value, but Max is quite ill and he worries about his wife and asked me if maybe it was worth anything.     So there you have it.  I have no idea what it costs to have it valued or what its value is or whether it would even be worth as much as its valuation fee, but  I feel I should do something for Max.

PK's assessment as of 15 September 2021: The UNEMA metadata indicates ""Central Australia"" but this is contradicted by the register of the Armidale Folk Museum which lists the place of origin for 1983.2.74  as ""Western Qld, Boulia?"" and the place of origin for 1983.2.75  as ""Gulf of Carpentaria dist.[district]"". My assessment is that ""Central Australia"" is wrong. There is no source for this information and it is likely an error that crept in when the objects were loaned to UNEMA. Message sticks are rare in Central Australia. Both objects also appear to have been made from the stem of a Banksia dentata, which does not grow in Central Australia.  I'm also sceptical of Western Qld, Boulia. The question mark in the register indicates that this is a guess, and in 1983 the most substantial descriptions of Australian message sticks were objects from Boulia (as described by Walter Roth). My informed guess is that they are both from the Gulf of Carpentaria. They could be compared to the Pitt Rivers Museum object PRM1989_46_8. Based on the distribution of Banksia dentata the materials harvesting for the manufacture of these objects  was conceivably Binbinka Country and its vicinity or one of the Wik Countries.",1,2082;2084,

Le vie di scambio attraversavano tutta l'Australia, dalle regioni tropicali del nord a quelle alpine del sud, fino alle pianure desertiche del centro e alle estese coste occidentali. La sopravvivenza in un continente così vasto e diverso dipendeva dagli spostamenti e dagli scambi di cibo e di risorse su lunghe distanze, e anche dagli obblighi matrimoniali e cerimoniali. Reti complesse operavano tramite relazioni di parentela, associazioni totemiche, legami di discendenza e responsabilità verso il proprio territorio. Tutto questo riduceva anche la conflittualità e il rischio di guerre tra clan vicini.  I bastoncini messaggio erano uno strumento di comunicazione. Incisi con punti e linee angolari, erano portati da messaggeri o circolavano tra i diversi clan e gruppi linguistici per trasmettere informazioni e messaggi, ad esempio inviti per un corroboree o per un incontro. Dopo la colonizzazione gli spostamenti degli Aborigeni hanno subito forti limitazioni e i percorsi tradizionali sono stati sbarrati dalle recinzioni.

1314,SAM_AA298_4_2_3,Sketch of a message stick  made by W. R. Pennifold belonging to Batjamalh region,,"This sketch is from a letter written to N. B. Tindale dated 26 November 1927. The full letter is as follows:  ""Transcription of: AA298/4/2/3  Message Sticks N Territory by Pennifold  Answered 2.4.28  And sent reprint  E.E.T.b. Darwin  Nov. 26th 1927  Dear Tindale,  Probably you are wondering what has become of me as its over 12 months since I left the “Garden City” and after 5 months in Singapore managed to get a transfer to Darwin + here I am (married at last) + will be here for another 18 months or perhaps longer.   Well I often think of the Entomologists in Adelaide + although I don’t get much time for collecting the wily insect I never miss the opportunity of popping an unwily Coleoptera into the odd spot of alcohol.  My chief reason for pushing this pen is to let you into a little information which I acquired from an old Larakera nigger which will probably interest you. Perhaps you will recall [1] the very pleasant evening spent at the Anthropological Society’s meeting, the subject being “Aboriginal message sticks. Since my arrival in Darwin I’ve kept a sharp lookout for these “Message Sticks” but for some unknown reason they appear to be very uncommon + the only one I’ve managed to acquire – if it really is one – being one I found in the bush slighly charred by a bush fire. Nearby I also found a broken spear. I wil endeavour to sketch the stick to give you some idea of what its like.   On showing it to my nigger who belongs to the Wogite tribe he unhesitatingly informed me that it had come from his country, but on being asked what it meant he said; “Him all same letter”, after several futile attempts [2] to get him to read its meaning to me he said; “No more read this one Boss.” “Can other Blackboy read him?” “No more.”  This puzzled me, so I made further enquiries, but although several natives informed me that it was all same letter, none of them made any attempt to read it.   The other evening I was questioning an old Larrakera boy who is far above the average native in intelligence + his English is quite good for a native. On my telling him that I knew a man (Prof. Wood-Jones) who was very interested in these sticks he wanted to know if I meant Spencer. He remembers when the Darwin-Pine-Ck railway was built, when China-town consisted of bark-huts, in fact he is most intelligent for an abo. Probably because he has [3] been associated with whites most of his life.  Well, I asked him if he could make message sticks + he informed me that the message sticks his tribe made were merely tokens. Perhaps it would be better if I wrote this as the conversation actually took place. “One man he sit down + makeim stick then he burn mark on wood with red-hot wire. By-+-by he give this stick to another black-boy + tell him take it alonga so-and-so + tell him I bin send it + that I want matches, flour or anything else like that. When my friend bin receive this stick he say to boy. “Who bin sendum this one, eh?” “Berber bin sendum this one: Well what him want, eh? Then he tell him I want matches + flour.”  I then told Berber (the old abo) that some blacks can read [4] these sticks the same as a white man reads a letter.  “Yes I sabby that too Boss but no more alonga my tribe, or Melville Is, Wogite, Woolma Brengan boy, but black-fella longa Daly Waters, Powells Crk, Boorooloola + other side him plenty sabby.” “Can you read their message sticks Berber?” “I only sabby one fella.” “And what’s that?” “When him makum three spots that mean big row” “What big fight Eh?” “Yes, big fight.”  “Well why don’t your tribe + the tribes about here make these letter sticks eh? “We no bin learn ‘em” “What about long time ago b4 white-man come here?” “No more we neber bin learn’em all about here.” “Why haven’t your tribe learnt it? “I dunno Boss.”  Well Tindale you can see by that, that Christie who [5] got up that night at the meeting + said that the natives couldn’t read these sticks as he had made them himself for the blacks, was correct in what he said for he was speaking of Point Charles which is only 15 miles from Darwin, + the sticks made by those natives are not “message sticks but “token” sticks.  Personally I think that this is rather a valuable piece of information + something for you to work on, if you haven’t already heard of it.  You may if you wish make use of this letter at the Anthropological Socys. meeting  It appears to me that this hieroglyphical art was first learnt in the South + gradually worked its way Nth.  Perhaps it orginated in Victoria where the Cohuna [?] [6] skulls have come from. It would be very interesting to trace in what part of Australia this art had reached its highest standard when the white race arrived.  Well Tindale I must close this, if there is anything I could do to assist you or Mr. Lea in any way, just let me know + I will be only too pleased to do it.   Of course I’m now looking for an Abo who hails from the vicinity of Daly Waters who can make the real message sticks. I do hope that the above will prove of interest to you if not of any value. Give my kindest regards to Mr. Lea + his wife not forgetting yourself.  Sincerely yrs.  W.R.

It was in the collection of Pastor Friedrich Wilhelm Albrecht who worked at Hermannsberg and the headwear of the man on the left would suggest Central Australia (where message sticks were not widely used). What this image appears to represent is an equivalence between the written word and the message stick. Another interpretation is that the man on the left is holding a tjurunga (sacred objects that Arrernte people at Hermannsberg decided to abandon) and the man on the right is holding a Bible which is shown as replacing traditional spiritual beliefs.

When Buma-buma reached the distant camp he demanded, in the name of his father, two girls instead of two boys. Though the old men agreed to the demand, they were somewhat suspicious of the unusual request. On nearing Wialpa, Buma-buma, hiding the girls in the jungle, told his father that the old men of the distant people wanted at least another year before their youths were ready for circumcision. The father, who did not believe that story, demanded more and further more details, until Buma-buma was forced to admit he had brought girls instead of boys. The men, and especially the father, were so enraged over Buma-buma's disobedience and its consequent disgrace that they speared the young man to death. After the burial rituals of Buma-buma, the men at Wialpa were so ashamed of his actions that they changed themselves into water-birds, which still live in the nearby fresh-water swamps.  At the present time the ceremonial message stick on which the figure of Buma-buma is engraved, is sent to a group of aborigines who have a boy ready for circumcision. Although the designs on the stick refer specifically to the death and burial of Buma-buma, and not to circumcision, the myth of Buma-buma's disobedience and punishment is so well known that the significance of the message stick is understood. p. 471.

He did landscapes, illustrations for newspapers and for a period was employed by Stanford of American university fame. Yesterday I was showing a friend my collection of copies of his artworks and came across the attached, which I'd completely forgotten was in the collection. It's highly unlikely the picture was an eyewitness account as there's no evidence James was ever on Dagworth station or in Queensland (he was mostly in Victoria, but did visit Tasmania, New Guinea, New Zealand and various pacific islands). I suspect it was done as a newspaper illustration. The caption doesn't really fit as the men are holding 'paper yabber', not a 'flag of truce', which more likely would be a green branch.""

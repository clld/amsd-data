The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net ""yamma"" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him.

Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.

This stick was sent by an Oboo of the Wakelbura to one of the Yangebura tribe (at Blackall). The wood is this of Bedyea tree--which belongs to the Wooltheroo class--of which Oboo is a subclass. The message refers to killing game found in a fenced paddock at Mr Wallaces station near Clermont. The game is Emu and Wallaby which are both of the Wooltheroo class and therefore claimed by Oboo and Wongoo. The messenger delivers a verbal message. The marks are according to Mr Muirhead as follows: [2 drawings, the first marked 'Wallaby' and 'Emu' besides the stripes of decoration, the 2nd drawing is annotated 'This indicates the wire fence at Kilcommon Station'] [2] [2] James C. Muirhead. Note that there is correspondence between Muirhead and Howitt at AIATSIS Howitt papers. I can find nothing else about him.

The spearthrower has an oval carved on its widest part and towards the centre there is an image of a tiny hand. Note that it may not be immediately identifiable as a spearthrower because it was repurposed as a message stick! If the spearthrower is in your collection I would love to have: 1. digital photographs of it , 2. photographs of any accompanying documentation or labels, 3. photographs of any other message sticks that James Dawson may have collected.  Evidence for the existence of the message stick, as described by James Dawson, can be viewed here on page 73 of 'Australian Aborigines': https://archive.org/stream/australianaborig81daws#page/n88/mode/1up  ... where there is a full description.    There is also a sketch of the message stick apparently by James Dawson but published by the German anthropologist Adolf Bastian in 1881. You can see it here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/42261673@N08/47831421901/in/album-72157708391717725/    The Camperdown Heritage Centre replied (14 May 2019):  ""Dear Piers,    Thank you for your email and payment for research/photographs.    James Dawson's natural history collection was displayed in a room at the Shire of Hampden offices after being built in 1885/86 until the Mechanics Institute was rebuilt in 1890. The collection was then housed in the ""Museum Room"" on the second floor. Dawson had requested a second floor be built to ensure his collection would not be kept in damp rooms. His will and probate papers show that he left his natural history  and native weapons collections to the Mechanics Institute Museum, all of which had been housed there for the past 7 years on his death in 1900.    Unfortunately the collection was broken up with a section transferred to the State School in 1936 and other items to the Higher Elementary School at some stage. The latter school was destroyed by fire in 1940 and the State School in 1965. All records etc were lost in both fires, and also the museum collections.    The Camperdown Historical Society was formed in 1960, firstly with no premises. A small ground floor room at the Mechanics Institute was then provided, with little display room. In 1984 the Town of Camperdown council provided our current premises which allow for a good amount of display space.  We have a small collection of aboriginal artefacts which mostly came from the collection of Dr Hope who looked after the Aboriginals at Buntingdale Mission near Birregurra. He was apparently given items in payment for his services. These were housed for some years at Chocolyn School (near Camperdown) until it closed. They were then stored by a local resident before gifting them to our Society.    We have double checked the items we have but unfortunately none resemble the description of the item you requested.    As you have deposited funds into our account but we are unable to help would you like photos of some of the items we do hold?  If you would like a refund please provide your bank account details.    One of our members and a regular volunteer is a GG Grand-daughter of James Dawson and custodian of family information but knows no more than I have written.    Sorry we could not be of more help.

The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net ""yamma"" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him. The old man showeed mine to my correspondent with much mystery after sending all the women away from the place    These are all the contributions which I can send you this time but more will follow as soon as I can get them drawn -- I do this because I cannot yet tell whether in the work for which I am gathering materials I may or may not require illustrations of these things.

It was made for him by ""the native doctor who was to accompany [Unaipon] on his northern trip as interpreter"".     There are at least three avenues of inquiry:    1) It would be worth finding out about Unaipon's northern trip, presumably this means north in relation to Adelaide where The Register was published. If the identity of the interpreter could be discovered this would help isolate the linguistic area associated with the message stick (Unaipon's own affiliation is Ngarrindjeri). The preceding article in the Register is here: http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64244883    PK contacted Tim Rowse on 27 August 2019, who suggested contacting Philip Jones.    Other ways to narrow the search would be to find these names of people ""Warta Yunna"", ""Thumgara"", ""Kow Wona"", ""Mulgarra"", ""Quenra"", ""Mindala"", ""Bungala"", ""Matharoo"", ""Oora"", ""Kow Dull"", ""War Tura"".     2) Identify the language used in the interpretation.  Special clues for the language are   thumgara=dew  kow wona= thunder cloud  oora = wild grass bark  kow dull= wild potato  wommena= boomerangs    In Chirila lexical dataset:  dew = cannot find equivalent to thumgara  thunder = koːɹanna or koːɹunna in Parnkala, koːɹoːna in Wirangu, koːnoː in Yalarrnga (too far away)  wild potato = cannot find equivalent to kow dull    wongela= boomerang on Barcoo river (Queensland or SA?)  wungela = boomerang in Yambina (too far away)  waŋala = boomerang in Yuwi  wunggela = boomerang in Blackall-Barcoo River (probably QLD)  woomera= boomerang according to 'Aboriginal Names of Places with their Meanings, etc' (this could just be a mistake since woomera is Eora word for spear-thrower, after which the place derives its name)    According to Curr boomerang is panketyi in Ngarrindjeri.    So far the best lead is Parnkala and the adjacent Wirungu language. However in the Barngala dictionary based on Clamor Wilhelm Schurmann returns:  dew = yarlda; boorgoo  thunder = goorrana  cloud=mabinya; malgoo; baloowara  boomerang = wadna [used in Port Lincoln only for killing fish]    3) Continuing from the above, of the 13 individuals mentioned in the interpretation, four have names that are glossed as nouns. This suggests that these might be totem names:  Thumgara (Dew)  Kow Wona (Thunder Cloud)   Chief Oora (wild grass bark)  Kow Dull (wild potato)    On this line of inquiry it might be worth looking at AustKin for totem systems north of Adelaide that include these names.     The name Matharoo could be a moiety name, per Arabana moiety matthurie (the other moiety is kirawara)",,"The message in question, of which diagram is shown, contains a war order from Warta Yunna, chief of all the surrounding minor chiefs.

The particulars are known only to the Karadja ""Wise Men"" of the tribes.""    Edmund Milne (1861-1917) was born in England and emigrated to Queensland with his parents 19 months later. He had had personal contact with Aboriginal people throughout his life, from when he was a small boy in Queensland and, from the late 1860s, in New South Wales. This contact may have led him to recording the names of Aboriginal people associated with particular objects in his collection, at a time when this was rarely done. Milne seems to have begun actively collecting Indigenous artefacts in the early 1880s and was still acquiring objects a few months before his death in 1917. His work with the NSW Railways (1876-1917) enabled him to meet a broad range of people who facilitated his collecting and associated activities like visiting Aboriginal sites. From at least the time he lived at Orange NSW (1906-1915), and later at Ryde (1915-1917), near to Sydney city, he displayed his collection at his home. In addition to a large collection of Aboriginal artefacts, Milne's collection included artefacts from the South Pacific and prehistoric implements from Egypt, France and England. In his will dated 12 December 1916, Milne bequeathed his 'Anthropological collection' to the 'first Federal Museum opened in the Federal Capital'. The collection remained at Ryde until early 1931 when it was acquired by the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. It remained there until the Institute's collections were transferred to the National Museum of Australia in 1985.",Unknown,1931,terminus ante quem,,2,1,5,57,18,,"The message stick is associated with the ""Mulga and Lachlan"" tribes in New South Wales.

The Dick and Lindsay Roughsey Collection comprises a cylindrical, wooden, message stick with a pointed lower end and a tuft of emu feathers bound with red fibre string. The surface of the message stick, painted by Mornington Island artists and brothers Dick and Lindsay Roughsey, is covered with goodwill symbols painted in black, yellow, red and white in geometric designs and lines, dots and dashes on a white background. It was presented to prominent scholar of Aboriginal studies, Dr F. D. McCarthy, in Canberra in 1972.    Although not universal throughout Aboriginal Australia, message sticks were used by many tribes, including Lardil people, for various reasons including the coordination of large socio-economic events, to summon others for initiation ceremonies, for hostile purposes or to convey messages relating to sickness or death. Traditional message or 'talking' sticks were made of soft wood, ornamented, carved and often painted bright colours, and marked in various ways with notches, dots, strokes, curves and geometric designs. Lardil artists and brothers, Dick (Goobalathaldin) and Lindsay (Burud), Roughsey, were prominent in reviving and preserving the art culture of the Lardil people which has a long history stemming from traditions of body painting and shows strong affinities to ceremonial designs stretching to Central Australia. Beginning with bark painting, inspired by his visits to Arnhem Land in the 1950s, Dick Roughsey, OBE, went on to become internationally renowned for his children's books and remains one of Australia?s most significant artists.

Message sticks are found in museums and archives but they also circulate among private sellers and collectors. Sadly, the histories of these objects are often not recorded or poorly maintained. Auction houses, for example, will not even reveal the names of their owners or previous owners for privacy reasons so stories and connections are quickly lost.     The AMSD is keeping track of message sticks that are sold and resold in order to trace their movements. We also hope that by posting the images from these sales, interested members of the public might recognise the objects and help us contextualise them.

It contains within its markings, a reference to Māgaya, which is the responsibility of the Parliament to the citizens. Māgaya is the peace, order and good government afforded the people constitutionally under Customary Law in a manner similar to the Australian Constitution as stated in section 5l.  The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of the Northern Territory is seen as breaking these fundamental constitutional responsibilities placed upon the Parliament. Further, Yolŋu Customary Law – ""Common Law"" – defines the enactment of the Northern Territory Act as an illegal action of sorcery punishable at law.  For this reason this message endorses the action of Kevin Andrews MP to bring a Private Member's bill which will overturn the NT Act.

Bastian writes: ""Rein zufällig war jedenfalls die Beobachtung, soweit sie mich angeht. Durch einen Zufall gewissermaassen gelangte ich nach Cooktown, durch einen Zufall wurde ich einige Tage dort aufgehalten, und durch einen Zufall wieder kam ich mit einem der dortigen Bewohner in ein Gespräch, in dessen Laufe ich durch eine zufällige Neben-[240]-bemerkung aufmerksam wurde und zum Weiterfragen veranlasste. Zuesrt hörte ich in Gesellschaft mit Hrn. St. Georges, dem Police-Magistrate, und einem alten Colonisten, dem Australien seine zweite Heimath geworden war, von dem ausgedehnten System von Signale sprechen, wodurch sich die australischen Stämme (besonders am Dawson) auf weite Entfernung hin verständlich zu machen wüssten, von den in Bäumen eingeschnitzten Zeichen (ähnlich den in Höhlen angetroffenen  Malereien), von Verzierungsformen u. dergl., und dann wurden auch einander zugeschickte Briefe erwähnt. Ich hielt dies mehr für eine Facon de parler und konnte an demselben Abend, wo ich von einer Erkundigung auf die andere geführt wurde, nicht wieder darauf zurückkommen. Am nächsten Morgen traf ich mit einem Sergeanten der sog. Black Police (gleich den meisten Offizieren dieses trefflich organisierten Corps über die Eingebornen wohlunterrichtet) zusammen, und als ich das Gespräch auf denselben Gegenstand brachte, erhielt ich zu meiner Verwunderung  nicht die halb und halb erwartete Widerlegung, sondern eine Bestätigung. Genauere Erklärungen, auf welche ich jetzt einzugehen suchte, konnte mein Gewährsmann mir leider nicht geben, versprach mir jedoch bei einem seiner Leute, der mit allem Dahingehörigen gut bekannt sei, als Dolmetscher zu deinen, sobald er aus der Station nach der Stadt kommen würde. Hier war ein Dilemma. Die Station war ziemlich entfernt, der Dampfer, den ich bei meinem genau berechneten Reiseplan nicht versäumen durfte, war bereits eingelaufen und konnte jeden Augenblick zur Wiederabfahrt fertig sein. Dabei war ich durch das Verpacken einiger am Platze erlangter Sammlungsgegenstände beansprucht und auch noch durch andere Besorgungen. Ein freier Moment musste indess geschaffen werden, worin ich mich nach dem in der Vorstadt gelegenen Polizeiposten begab und dort einen schwarzen Unteroffizier ausfindig machte, der zu den Intelligenteren seines Gleichen gehörte. Freilich war sein specifisch-australisches Pidgeon-English mit so vielen technischen Wendungen durchwebt, dass das Verständniss allerei Hin- und Herfragen erforderte. Damit gingen viele Minuten verloren, und doch andere, bis richtig aufgefasst war, was ich eigentlich wolle, dann war das Holz zu beschaffen (und zwar die für Kerben geeignete Art), dann ein Messer, was, wie immer in solchen Fällen (wenn es auf Eile ankommt), gerade nicht bei der Hand war, darauf der Brief zu schreiben oder zu schneiden, ferner zu erklären – und für das Ganze blieb mir kaum eine halbe Stunde. Ich fühlte mich deshalb von dem Resultat auch im Grunde nur wenig befriedigt, und unzufrieden mit mir selbst, da über mehrere der Cautelen, die gerade bei einer Untersuchung so hochwichtiger Art auf das Strengste hätten festgehalten werden müssen, allzu leicht fortgeschlüpft war, von dem Ticken der Taschenuhr gedrängt. Indess, wie die Sachen lagen, mussten sie gelassen werden, und mir blieb nichts übrig, als mich einzuschiffen.""",1;3;2,175;1140;1141;1142;1143;1144;1145;1146,

The only words missing in the account of the shipwreck are what I interpret as “Ausfahrt”, “Herfahrt” and something illegible with the German ß at the end. Therefore, it might be something old I don’t know.As to picture two (4700), the sentence does not really make sense, especially the verb “trägt” but I’m almost certain my interpretation of the handwriting is correct in this case. Maybe the author himself left out a word.""    Piers marked up location info ("".... W. Australien) and material in far right column for review by Anneke H. She wrote in reply: ""What I can say for certain is that the horizontal red circle to the right contains “cm lang Australien”. Which of course doesn’t make any sense. The “cm lang” is part of the description of the message stick (29,5cm long). The “Australien” may be the extension of the column to the right (vertical circle). Concerning the right circle I’d say the first word starts with a capital G and I would bet it continues over the next line because the next word starts with what looks like an h or f. There are not many German words this length starting with an h or f. It does look like “Gef-hart…horn” but that’s not even a word. I’ts very likely the passage end with “Carl Sahl in Sidney” but to be honest, without your hint I wouldn’t have read “Carl” because the ending is that blurry. What’s really interesting is the modern, not Sütterlin e in Sidney.     I can’t really make sense of the writing in the horizontal circle to the left containing W. Australia but noticed some oddities there as well. The hand writing looks different from the rest. First of all it’s written in pencil instead of ink. And the capital A looks different and a lot newer. It’s possible this was written later and by a different person. The numbers following the “W. Australien” look like this person referenced a different section or message stick. If you have the corresponding files “2582 u[nd] 2233/36” they might give you a hint on what the author tried to reference. And he had a terrible handwriting, that’s for sure.""    Piers replied: ""Thanks Anneke,   This is really useful. I had incorrectly guessed that ""cm lang"" was ""sammlung""!    The crossreferences to other artefacts aren't usually helpful. Often they are preceded by ""dgl."" which stands for dergleichen and the comparison is usually on the basis of visual similarities rather than origins.    My bad guess for the words preceding W.Australien was something like ""dorf__ W. Australien"". There are very few settlements in the north west of Western Australia, where I suspect the artefact comes from, but the word doesn't like any village I know from that area. (In fact, I lived in that region for three years.)    Thanks again for taking the time with this,  Piers""    Anneke replied: ""“Dorf” could be possible but the first letter is a little too small to pass for a capital D. Plus, the capital W and A are not written in Sütterlin style. Therefore it seems likely the author would have written a modern D as well. Yet again, this is just a wild guess. Said letter could also be “v” followed by “o” and… something “h”-ish. Maybe “f” but “h” seems more likely because the lower… how do you call that? Anyway, the lower part of the letter is not strait but bent.    In writing that I just realized the next word is most certainly “sicher”. What I first thought was “u” looks more like “i” followed by “c”. That would make “…h sicher W[est] Australien”. Does that make any sense?    And a minor addition to the part on the right (it seems I’m having way too much fun deciphering this): if the first two lines are still written in Sütterlin, the first word on the second line could be “herrn”. That would make “Ge…- herrn Carl Sahl in Sidney”. Again, all the letters in Sahl and Sidney look much more modern than the rest, so the two words in the beginning could contain a mixture of old and new letters. Anyway, I doubt that whatever is written there contains a specific location.    I hope that helps. If you come across another illegible passage, feel free to ask me!

There was much discussion amongst anthropologists in the late nineteenth century about the use of message sticks in different parts of Australia. It was thought that they were widely used and would have served a range of functions such as signifiers of safe passage through new territories or as invitations. It has been suggested that the notches on the stick probably acted as reminders rather than as a language that could be read. Today they stand as an icon of Australian Aboriginal culture.

A short stick of light coloured wood with a series of short, narrow grooves or notches, 'V'-shaped in section, cut along the sides giving the piece of wood a quadrangular cross section. These cuts are reminiscent of 'tally grooves', and of the series of short grooves found on rock engraving sites in the Grafton district of the Clarence valley, and in north-eastern South Australia. Such rock engravings are not found in the Richmond River district. The longer grooves on the message sticks are cut on nopposed sides (nineteen on one, twenty on the other) as are also the shorter grooves (fourteen on one side, thirteen on the other). The message stick measures 9.9 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm.    The pair of message sticks is a unique specimen. No other examples from this area are known, and there is only one reference to their use in the local literature. Bray (1923:7) mentions that 'messages from tribe to tribe were carried verbally except very important ones. This [sic] were marked on a stick by means of notches'. To the south we have records of their use at Port Stephens (Scott 1929:33-4), but unfortunately no description of their features. To the north in Queensland such stick were used, and there are surviving examples in the Queensland Museum's collections. Some of these bear notches, as do the Richmond River specimens, though the particular examples do not come from south-east Queensland (see Hamlyn-Harris 1918:19, 20, 26, 27). Such message sticks apparently served a double purpose; they were 'memory sticks' for the bearer, and guarantees of his good faith as he travelled through the territory of different tribal groups. There seems to be little information on their use in eastern New South Wales, though they are reasonably well documented for other areas such as the Darling basin and central Australi (Hamlyn-Harris 1918; Howitt 1904:678-710).""

Strong replied: ""Piers is correct - the 1911 expedition were a fair distance from Adelaide River. If it was collected by Hill, in 1911, and if the origin of the items was Adelaide River, then they must have been traded/travelled from there. However, I would have thought that Hill would have mentioned them in his diary and I’m pretty sure I would have noted that. It is far more likely that Hill collected them while Economic Botanist in Darwin."" He also attached an excel spreadsheet with metadata for item X25839 as follows:     Accession Lot: (Collection Details): [X 25839] Hill, Mr Gerald Freer (Purchase)    Collection Name: (Collection Details): G.F. Hill Collection    Object/Medium: (Object Details): Ornament, unidentified; Message stick  Object Description: A band made of glass beads possibly strung on European cotton/linen thread. A small wooden message stick is attached to one end.  State/Province: (Locality Details): Northern Territory  Specific Locality: (Locality Details): Darwin  Circa: (Collection Details): 1918  Accession Date: (Accession Details): 17 Dec 1918    Nash subsequently wrote: ""Well spotted Bruce.  Accession by purchase in 1918... when did he first travel to Melbourne  after the 1911 expedition?    And I note that at the end of that expedition he took the train from  Pine Creek to Darwin 15-17 April 1912, so would have had a chance to  pick up something at Adelaide RIver?  David""    Strong replied: ""According to his own account he ""arrived in Melbourne in June or July, 1912…”. In a memo of his dated 23 October 1912 he noted that he had virtually finished processing all specimens. [Regarding Nash's query re journey from Pine Creek to Darwin] Possibly.  According to a Departmental memo written late August 1912 ”...natural history specimens [I assume this includes those of Aborigial origins?] …left by Mr. Hill with Professor Spencer when Mr. Hill went to Hong Kong three months ago.”  My gut feeling is that X25838 was collected while Hill was Entomologist.

1024,,Description of Woiwurrung message stick communication,77,"From Brough Smythe, R. 1878. The Aborigines of Victoria: With notes relating to the habits of natives of other parts of Australia and Tasmania. Vol. I. Melbourne & London: John Ferres. p133:     ""When a [unspecified Victorian] tribe is encamped, it is not permitted to any other tribe to approach the camp without warning. Bent on revenge, or with an intent to murder, or for the purpose of stealing a young woman, a warrior will sometimes invade a camp in the night and seek to effect his purpose, but such enterprizes are not of very common occurrence. Whether for friendly intercourse or for war, the tribe which seeks a meeting must give notice of its coming in due form. A messenger (We-ar-garr), whose duty it is to proceed to the camp and state the intentions of the visitors, or to invite them to come to the camp of his tribe, is formally appointed by the principal man of the tribe, assisted by the old men in council. The young men are not allowed, under any circumstances, to take part in such deliberations as may be preliminary to so important a matter as a visit to or the reception of another tribe. On very solemn occasions two ambassadors or messengers are appointed; ordinarily, only one. The messenger has to carry a token, by virtue of which he passes safely through the lands of the several tribes. The token is a piece of wood, eight or ten inches in length, sometimes round and sometimes flat, and seldom more than one inch in thickness. On it are inscribed hieroglyphics which can be read and interpreted, and which notify all persons of the nature of the mission. If the mission is a friendly one, the stick is streaked mostly with red-ochre (Werrup); but if unfriendly, or for the purpose of demanding satisfaction for injuries done, or for war, then it is mostly streaked with white-ochre (Ngarrimbul). The principal man, in putting this stick into the hands of the messenger, and having named the tribe for which the invitation is intended, says, “You hold this now” (Koong-ak kinee Mirrambinerr). “Look out and find plenty of blackfellows” (Yane-wat benjer oonee kolen). “You tell all blackfellows to come here” (Toombooni boole-anin kolen-yan-an niool or Tom-buk U-mar-ko Koolin Ner-lin-go).""",,1878,terminus ante quem,,4,,,1,,,"On 30 August 2018, Barry Blake wrote to Piers Kelly: ""The language is the language of the Melbourne area, which I was calling Woiwurrung.

The stick may have come from from any of the WA areas he explored, and dates.... who knows.  I found the stick amongst my father's effects while he was very ill and close to death. I asked him about it but he couldn't even remember that he had it. I have bull roarers and boomerangs that Wells left to my dad. He had been given them by various Aboriginal people- probably in WA, though he did explore in SA until he was 73.    My wife and I have lived and worked with Aboriginal people for over 40 years in the NT. When I showed the stick to some of the Tennant Creek men they did not respond much. They would have told me had they any knowledge of such an object. We likewise have been given a plethora of artefacts from the Tennant Creek/Barkly Tableland region.    I have tried looking on the WWW for images of similar things but only found much cruder message sticks and so that is why I contacted you.    Thank you for responding to my email.    best wishes""    Piers Kelly replied: ""Hi Richard,  How very interesting. I would say your great grandfather's message stick is plausibly from WA.

In a quick search of the database I've found this polished sandalwood style as far north Roebourne and as far south as Rottnest Island.

Just let me know and I'll generate log-in details.    Would it be possible for me to include your artefact in the database too? It's certainly a fine piece of work, and other experts might have more to say about it than me.     All the best,    Piers  P.S. Do you remember which university researchers you contacted in WA?

Zum Teil sind die Zeichnungen der Tjurunga und Schwirrhölzer auch mit Nummern versehen, deren Zuordnung jedoch unklar bleibt. Sie können weder mit den Original-Objekt- nummern von Hermann Klaatsch, die teilweise noch auf den von ihm gesammelten Objekten erhalten sind, noch mit den Objekt- nummern in der Klaatschsammlung des Rautenstrauch-Joest- Museums in Übereinstimmung gebracht werden. Es liegen Zeichnungen oder Pausen von elf Tjurunga bzw. Schwirrhölzern mit Nummern sowie Zeichnungen oder Pausen von fünf Tjurunga bzw.  Schwirrhölzern ohne Nummern vor (zum Teilin zwei Hälften sowie Vorder- und Rückseite gesondert gezeichnet).  Neben den Tjurunga- und Schwirrholzmustern gibt es auch zwei sehr ausdifferenzierte Muster von länglichen Objekten, die wegen der vielfältigen enthaltenen Informationen aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach Botenstäbe darstellen. Eine angedeutete Schnur, befestigt an einem Ende des länglichen Stabes, weist jedoch auch auf eine Nutzung als Schwirrholz hin. Während eines der Botenstabmuster lediglich geometrische Längs- und Querschnitte aufweist, ist das andere mit geometrischen Schnitten und einer figürlichen Darstellung versehen. Ausführliche Erläuterungen am Rand der Zeichnung erklären die Striche oder Schnitte auf dem Holz als kalendarische Angaben (Tage, Monate, Mond) und verweisen außerdem auf drei Stämme, die gemeinsam einen Corroboree abhalten. Die figürliche Darstellung ist „The strange king"" betitelt.  Wie weitere Notizen auf diesen (zweiteiligen) Blättern belegen, wurde dieser Botenstab in Daly River (im westlichen Arnhem Land, Nordterritorium) von einem Mitglied des ,,Mullock Mullock Tribe” angefertigt. Dem anderen Botenstabmuster sind zwar auch ergänzenden Erläuterungen hinzugefügt, es existiert aber keine Herkunftsangabe.  Wie mehrfache Erwähnungen von Botenstäben in den Briefen an Schoetensack belegen, war Klaatsch an dem Phänomen dieser einfachen Nachrichtenübermittlung sehr interessiert. [fn:61: So z.B. in Brief Nr.14 und Brief Nr. 33 von Klaatsch an Schoetensack, PHK] Auch zeichnete er die Anordnung der Einritzungen in einem Brief an seinen Heidelberger Freund auf. Allerdings zeigte er sich enttäuscht von der profanen Bedeutung der Zeichen: Die diagonalen Striche in die eine Richtung bedeuteten nichts anderes als ,,Unser ,tribe’ kommt in dieser Richtung” und diagonale Striche in die gegenläfige Richtung ,,Euer ,tribe’ soll aus der anderen Richtung kommen”; die aus diesen aufeinander zulaufendedn diagonalen Strichen zusammengesetzen Winkel bedeuteten: ,,Dann wollen wir uns treffen und zusammen Corroboree abhalten”. Klaatschs ernuuchterter Kommentar dazu lautet: ,,Ich hatte mehr complicirte Dinge erwartet und erhofft, werde meine Studien fortsetzen”[fn:62: Brief Nr. 14, S.25, von Klaatsch an Schoetensack vom 5.-15 Oktober 1904, Telegraphenstation Floraville bei Burketown, PHK]"" p38    In Erckenbrecht, Corinna. 2010. Auf der Suche den Ursprüngen: Die Australienreise des Anthropologen und Sammlers Hermann Klaatsch 1904-1907. Cologne: Gesellschaft für Völkerkunde, Verein zur Förderung des Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museums der Stadt Köln.    JB Translation: ""Klaatsch copied or traced the patterns of sacred objects (tjurunga and bullroarers) as well as the patterns of message sticks, or he made impressions of them with soft vegetable fiber. Partly the drawings of tjurunga and bullroarers are also accompanied with numbers, their assignment remains unclear. They can be matched neither with the original object numbers of Hermann Klaatsch, some of which are still preserved on the objects he has collected, nor with the object numbers in the Klaatsch collection of the Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum. There are drawings or traced sketches of eleven tjurunga or bullroarers with numbers, as well as drawings or traced sketches of five tjurunga and bullroarers without numbers (drawn separately to split two halves as well as front and back).  In addition to the tjurunga and bullroarers, there are also two very differentiated patterns of elongated objects. They most probably depict message sticks because they contain diverse information. However, an implied string attached to one end of the elongated stick, also indicates it being used as a bullroarer. While one of the message stick’s patterns has only geometric longitudinal and cross sections, the other one has geometric sections and a figurative depiction.  Detailed explanations at the edge of the drawing claim the lines or cuts on the wood to be calendar data (days, months, moon), and also refer to three tribes that hold a corroboree together. The figurative depiction is titled ""The strange king”. According to the further notes on these (two-part) pages, this message stick was made in Daly River (in western Arnhem Land, Northern Territory) by a member of the ""Mullock Mullock Tribe"". Although the patterns on the other message stick were also accompanied with explanations, there is no indication of origin.  According to several references to message sticks in the letters to Schoetensac, Klaatsch was very interested in the phenomenon of this simple communication. [fn:61: So z.B. in Brief Nr.14 und Brief Nr. 33 von Klaatsch an Schoetensack, PHK] He also sketched the arrangement of the carvings in a letter to his friend Heidelberg.  However, he was disappointed by the mundane meaning of the signs: the diagonal strokes in one direction mean nothing other than “our tribe comes in that direction”, and diagonal strokes in the opposite direction mean “your tribe should come from another direction”; the angles composed of these diagonal lines mean: ""Then we want to meet and hold Corroboree together."" Klaatsch's commentary is: ""I had expected more complicated things and hoped I to continue my studies”.

Murray Garde (2014, 104-105) wrote: ""Using a ‘big placename’ to refer to an outstation can in some contexts create confusion when such big names have also become designations for other focal sites in the ‘estate’. An example of this involves the kun-bolkngeykimuk or ‘big placename’ of Kubumi, which was used to refer to an outstation on the Mann River established in the early 1980s by people of the Kulmarru clan. The kun-bolkngeyyahwurd or ‘small placename’ for the location of the outstation is Yikarrakkal. The focal place for Kubumi is a stretch of the Mann River where the river widens and white sandy banks are a popular camping place for people from the outstation, which is located only a kilometre upstream to the south. In the period of 1990 to 1997 when I lived at Yikarrakkal, movement between the outstation and the river camp was constant. With both the outstation and the river camp both being referred to by the name Kubumi, it became very difficult to disambiguate reference to these two places when speaking to people who did not live at Yikarrakkal. In 1990 the community decided to deal with this confusion by using the kun-bolkngeyyahwurd of Yikarrakkal for the outstation and the kun-bolkngeykimuk Kubumi, for the river camp. Kuninjku people in the Mann River region will refer to the outstation as either Yikarrakkal or Kubumi depending on their assessment of shared knowledge with interlocutors. ‘Big names’ are more widely known outside of the local sphere of interaction.""

In Indigenous and minority placenames: Australian and international perspectives, edited by Ian D Clark, Luise Hercus and Laura Kostanski, 97-121.

East Alligagor River, 2 July 1912.  July 2nd  Late yesterday evening we were sitting in our mosquito-proof tent … when we heard a special singing, coming from the direction of the native camp. It was repeated again in the morning, when we found that the singing came from two youths who were standing close together facing one another, each of them leaning on a wand, coloured red and white. The song they sang was:  ‘Kadimanga,  Da laian a.  Da laian a.  Kadimanga,  Da laian a,  Da laian a.’  It was repeated time after time, and always the women, sitting in camp, replied with the refrain, ‘Wait Ba! Wait Ba!’’ repeated as often as they could without drawing breath. They sometimes do this fourteen or fifteen times. I often heard it thirteen, and naturally it dies away towards the close when their breath is exhausted. It is sung on a high note; the Wait is short, the Ba emphasised and prolonged. For days after the boys have come to the men’s camp they stand up every now and then and chant their song and, time after time, from camps, some so far away that you can only just hear the sound, comes back the refrain ‘Wait Ba! Wait Ba!’ it is one of the most picturesque of their songs, especially when heard in the bush at night time.""[fn:21:Spencer, Wanderings in wild Australia pp.765-6]    [Eds wrote]: Every Gaagudju man has to go through five initiation ceremonial stages during his lifetime. The first ceremony marks the point where a youth leaves the company of women and children and is accepted as a man, the final when he is an old man.  The two Megerrdji youths photgraphed here were visiting the Gaagudju camp at Oenpelli during a tour prior to their beginning the second stage of initiation. The wands they carry were instruments of save passage from one part of the country to another, made by themselves under the supervision of the elders. p151      From the SLSA: ""Two Aboriginal men carrying message sticks after setting out to summon members of distant tribes to initiation ceremonies on Melville Island, Northern territory. photograph; 9 x 15 cm  Magazine cutting.""

Mechanical humbug strikes again!!   Boat motors gave some people up the Liverpool River last week-end “big mobs of humbug”.  The first victim was John Hunter. John was on his way to visit the people at Maragulidban, taking an icebox to help them start a fishing business. He went up Maraguildban Creek first and picked up young Ivan Louie, one of the Peter Maryewongas sons at the top landing. Then they set out for Midui, the landing on the Liverpool River where the fishing boat was waiting.  A few hundred yards from the mouth of the creek the propeller stopped turning. John check out the shear pin and as that was ok, decided a broken drive shaft was to blame. John and Ivan Louie spent [2] Saturday night battling the mosquitoes and sandflies on a mud flat behind the mangroves. They expected the Gunwinggu boat Midui to come looking for them on Sunday but it didn’t show up. About 2pm the Pinders and Peter Cooke arrived on the scene in a 10ft boat. They took Ivan Louie back to the Maraguilidban Creek landing and were heading back to pick up John when their motor gave up the ghost.  John was waiting expectantly on the bank when they paddled into view about 6pm.  With a full moon to light the way and the guide with them they set out for Maningrida, 17 miles distant. They were nearing the junction of the Liverpool and Thompinson Rivers when a search party in the Crocodilus boat took the little boat in tow.   On Monday, Micky Nalaulman arrived back from a fishing trip with an icebox full of Maragulidban Creek barra and a message stick from the captain of the Midui, Curly Bagalubu.

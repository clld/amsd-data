[ZM 14/02/2013]    This is probably one of the object mentioned in a letter from Howitt [Howitt 10] of the Tylor papers PRM ms collections Box 12 of June 25 1883:     'Dear Dr Tylor Your letter of the 13th May reminds me that I have not yet sent the turndun which I promised in my last letter. The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net "yamma" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him. The old man showeed mine to my correspondent with much mystery after sending all the women away from the place    These are all the contributions which I can send you this time but more will follow as soon as I can get them drawn -- I do this because I cannot yet tell whether in the work for which I am gathering materials I may or may not require illustrations of these things. This will not however in any way affect any use to which you may decide to put them. They are yours to do with as you like. If there are any other blackfellows implements which you want I shall be delighted to try and obtain them for you.

Sketch of a message stick from Queensland reproduced by A.W.Hewitt (1889)	interpreted_artefact  glossed_artefact  	Sketch of a message stick (fig. 13.) in Howitt's 'Notes on Australian message sticks'	"a message stick used by the Mŭndainbŭra tribe at the Dawson River, in Queensland" (Howitt 1889, p. 325)	1889	terminus ante quem	"Message stick of the Mŭndainbŭra tribe, Queensland" (p. 332)	Image of a message stick (artefact missing)	Chirila: Mandandanji  Austlang: D44: Mandandanji  Glottolog: mand1417	 	 	Unable to identify 'Mundainbura' language of Queensland. In Thorpe (1909) 'Australian tribal names with their synonyms', 'Mundainbura' is noted as "North of Denham Range Queensland" which would place it in the vicinity of the Barna language. Other languages that match the general geographic vicinity are Wiri and Yambina.     However, in Howitt's text which ought to be considered more reliable, the message stick comes from the Dawson river (p. 325) which is further south, and his correspondent is from Durham Downs which would place the language in the vicinity of the Mandandanji language. This is closer to 'Mundainbura' given that -bura is typically a toponymic suffix in many Queensland languages. 	 	"My correspondent Mr. W. Logan, of Durham Downs, says of this stick as follows: "the notches in the upper edge represent a number of men of the Kūrgila class of the tribe. The two rows of dots below represent men respectively of the Kŭnbe and Wūngu classes. The notches on the lower edge represent men of the Kuburu class. The message with it was to invite these people to a corroboree." (p. 325)    In writing to a valued correspondent, Mr. R. Christison, of Lammermoor Station, on the subject of message sticks, I submitted to him a sketch of the Mundainbura message sticks with a request that he would ascertain what the men living with him of the Dalebura tribe could make of it; the Dalebura tribe has the same class divisions as those above noted.    In reply he wrote as follows: " I return the message you sent in your letter and I will explain all the blacks here can make of it. The top notches represent the Karagilla class; the bottom ones represent the Kooberoo class and the dots represent a wish to meet."  This statement is important as showing that the notches in the upper and lower edges have a definite meaning as the Kurgilla and Kuburu classes respectively." (Howitt 1889, p. 325)    "Fig. 13. Message stick of the Mundainbura tribe, Queensland, inviting to a corroboree. Upper line of notches represent men of the Kurgila clan, upper line of dots, men of the Kunbe clan, lower line of dots, men of the Wungu clan, and the lower line of notches men of the Kuburu clan.

The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net "yamma" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him. The old man showeed mine to my correspondent with much mystery after sending all the women away from the place    These are all the contributions which I can send you this time but more will follow as soon as I can get them drawn -- I do this because I cannot yet tell whether in the work for which I am gathering materials I may or may not require illustrations of these things. This will not however in any way affect any use to which you may decide to put them. They are yours to do with as you like.

"The following instance will show how message sticks are used in this tribe, figs. 15 and 16, Plate XIV, represent one which was sent by one of the Wakelbura, to a member of the Yangebura tribe at Blackall. The stick being sent by an Obu is Gidyea [Acacia homalophylla], timber being Wutheru. The message refers to game, (a) being for Emu, (b) for Wallaby, to be found near a certain wire netting fence, (c) on a station near Clermont. The marks on the stick do not convey their meaning without a verbal message. The man who takes the stick explains their meaning. If the stick were sent by a Mallera, everything marked on the stick would be Mallera, and it would be delivered to a Mallera. But the above described and figured stick was sent by Obu to Obu. The sticks are always painted, this one was coloured blue." (Howitt 1889, p. 326)      "Figs. 15 and 16.

(2) Message stick sent to me by Mr JF [insert] J.C. [end insert] Muirhead--used by the Wakelbura tribe. All message sticks are painted. This stick was sent by an Oboo of the Wakelbura to one of the Yangebura tribe (at Blackall). The wood is this of Bedyea tree--which belongs to the Wooltheroo class--of which Oboo is a subclass. The message refers to killing game found in a fenced paddock at Mr Wallaces station near Clermont. The game is Emu and Wallaby which are both of the Wooltheroo class and therefore claimed by Oboo and Wongoo. The messenger delivers a verbal message. The marks are according to Mr Muirhead as follows: [2 drawings, the first marked 'Wallaby' and 'Emu' besides the stripes of decoration, the 2nd drawing is annotated 'This indicates the wire fence at Kilcommon Station'] [2] [2] James C. Muirhead. Note that there is correspondence between Muirhead and Howitt at AIATSIS Howitt papers. I can find nothing else about him. Wallace's station refers to Donald Smith Wallace (1844-1900), and his station (Kilcommon?) near Clermont. He represented Clermont in the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1883-1888. [AP 06/02/2013]    In 1840 Isaac Reckitt rented a starch mill in hull, subsequently purchased in 1848, extending into other household products including washing blue, a bleaching agent. This became the family business Reckitt and Sons, which expanded into the overseas market, opening a business in Australia in 1886. There are examples of Australian Aboriginal material culture that use Reckitt's blue throughout Australia, including rock art at Nourlangie Rock, Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory.

"When handing the stick to Belay, Imball told him that Nanee and his tribe wished to meet him (Belay) and his tribe on the Cudnappa river for the purpose of holding a corroboree. Imnball further explained to Belay the devices on the stick as follows, which will be better understood by referring to plate VII: Nanee (a) sent the message from the Bokhara river (b), by the hand of Imball (c), via the Birie (d), the Culgoa (e), and Cudnappa (f) rivers, to Belay (g); that the stick was dispatched at new moon (h), and Belay and his tribe are expected to be at Cudnappa river (f) at full moon (i); (j) represents a corroboree ground, and Belay understands from it that Nanee and his tribe are corroboreeing at the Bokhara river, which is their taorai, and, further, that on the meeting of the two tribes at full moon on the Cudnappa river a big corroboree will be held.   The messenger, Imball, is shown standing beside Belay, which conveys the meaning that he will remain with the latter until he and his tribe are ready to start for the place of meeting, and that he, the messenger, will accompany them thither.

Nine wommeras represented by diamonds, and six spears by lines, are sent together with relatives of girls in payment for the two gins. The track indicates the distance to be traversed."

It was found close to Gregory Rivers (accordign to A. Merton) and is called "Muranda". Its entire surface is covered with symbols that are provided in samples. The bearer of the message stick was sent by a man and regarded two women. The first notch ment a young woman, the secon one ment a widow. The other symbols represented a battle that was going to take palce. Nine cubs were rendered with the help of rhombs, six spears were represented as straight lines.

Bishop White was so interested in the matter that he undertook to deliver the stick, but withheld the verbal message until he had satisfied himself that the receiver of the message had some knowledge of what the stick was [30] supposed to convey. Bishop White said he was no little surprised to find that the boy interpreted the request for head-bands and boomerangs correctly.  Since the accuracy of this instance is vouched for by the integrity of such a well-known cleric, we may also presume that the stick probably contained some mention of an exchange and the name of the boy by whom it had been sent.

Bischof White interessieite sich sehr fur die Sache und ubernahm den Stock selbst. Bei der Übergabe wußte der Knabe genau, was sein Freund von ihm verlange. Die Botschaft lautete im Pitehen-Englisch: "Want'em pretty fellow alonga head, boomerang." Er wünsehte somit Kopfbänder und Bumerangs. Bumerangs werden in Westaustralien öfter durch schiefe Kreuze dargestellt, wie sie auch auf dem in Frage stehenden Stab an gegeben sind. Es würde sich hier um 17 Bumerangs handeln, da die Zahl der Kreuze auf beiden Seiten 17 ist. Außer den Kreuzzeichen sind nur noch drei verschieden lange gerade Striche vorhanden, die vielleicht die Kopf bänder bedeuten können".

When he was leaving Darwin, a native boy brought this message stick and asked a coachman to deliver it to another boy at Daly water. Bishop White took much interest in the matter and took over the matter himself. When Bishop White handed the stick over to the boy at Daly water, he knew exactly what his friend wanted of him. The message was in Pitehen English: "Want'em pretty fellow alonga head, boomerang." He wanted headbands and boomerangs. Boomerangs in Western Australia are more often represented by oblique crosses, as the ones in the message stick in question.

"A definite message accompanied this stick, together with three war-spears, specially made and straight. The message was something to this effect:- A brother sends warning to his brother (by a third person) about a coming foe, who had set out to spear him owing to a fight over a lubra, and who was approaching by a given route. Owing to the wet season and the fact that the whole country was in flood ("big fella wata") it would take four moons to cover the journey.   The stick, which is made of Leichhardt pine, is covered with significant marks. On the obverse side the flood-waters are indicated by a deep gash whilst the four moons are enclosed in a circle by themselves. On the reverse three lines evidently refer to the three spears which accompanied the messenger. For the remainder, the zigzags with their number and variety cover the surface of the stick with the expectation of the two ends, which are unmarked."

Wathawurrung is inferred from the birthplace of Kaawirn Kuunawarn at Lake Connewarren in Victoria. 	 	Dawson (1881):    "The spear-thrower is also used as a message-stick ; but, when so employed, it is specially marked to indicate its purpose. The writer has in his possession a specimen which was made by Kaawirn Kuunawarn, the chief of the Kirræ Wuurong tribe, and which is a facsimile of a summons issued by him long ago to three tribes, to meet his own tribe at a favourite swamp and camping-place called Kuunawarn, on the east side of the River Hopkins, and represents their approach to his camp. In the centre of the flat side of the spear-thrower is a carved circle of about an inch and a quarter in diameter, which represents the camp of Kaawirn Kuunawarn. Near it are three notches on the edge of the stick, and two lines and two dots on the flat side, pointing to the camp, which form his signature ; and, at the hooked end of the stick, three lines in shape of the letter Z indicate his presence. Four rows of notches, extending from each end of the stick to the camp, indicate the numbers of individuals of the two tribes approaching from opposite directions. On the other side of the spear-thrower, in the centre, there are two circles of a smaller size, and pointing to them is a small, rudely carved figure of a hand—the word for ‘hand,’ munya, also means a ‘ meeting.’ From each end of the stick six lines of notches represent the numbers of individuals of other two tribes approaching from opposite directions. As each notch indicates an individual, there must have been a thousand at this meeting. Kaawirn Kuunawarn was then a very young chief ; and as he is now a man considerably over sixty years of age, the meeting must have been held immediately previous to the occupation of the country by the white man. Of those who attended it there are only four individuals now alive, viz., Kaawirn Kuunawarn, Jamie Ware, Jim Crow, and Helen Crow." (p73)    Frank writes: "So ist folgender Botenstab in drei Stammen in Gebrauch. Dawson übersetzt die Zeichen wie folgt: "... auf einer Seite sind Einschnitte, welche die Zahl der Stämme bezeichnen, die man erwartet, auf der anderen die Zahl der Männer, die er (der Sender) fordert" ... "Ein Speerwerfer als Botenstab von drei Stammen verstanden. Ein Häuptling zeigt seine Ankunft auf dem von seinem Stamm bevorzugten Sumpf und Versammlungsplatz, genannt Kuunawaru an der Ostküste des Hopkin-Flusses, an.   a) Das Feld von Kaawiru Kuunawaru.   b) Zeichen fur ein Lager.   c) Anwesenheit des Hauptlings an den angegebenen Platz.   d) Zahl der Individuen der beiden Stamme von entgegengesetzter Richtung kommend.   e) Zahl der Leute der zwei anderen Stamme. Es mussen an Tausend sich versammelt haben" (26, S. 72) (Fig. 28)." (p. 342)    Translation: "The following stick is used in three tribes. Dawson translates the symbols as follows: "[...] on the one side there are the notches that represent the number of tribes, that are expected. On the other side there is the amount of men that he (the sender) asks for." [...] "The stick is recognized by three tribes. The chief announced his arrival to the swamps that belonged to his tribe, and to the gathering area called Kuunawaru on the East coast of the Hopkin River.   a) The field of Kaawiru Kuunawaru.  b) The drawing of the camp.  c) The presence of the chief in the mentioned area.  d) Number of people from both tribes coming from the opposite directions.  e) Number of people from two other tribes. There must have been almost a thousend." (transl. Olena Tykhostup)      Adolf Bastian: "Die Zeichnung ist ein Facsimile eines Originals, durch Ihren [Hr. J. Dawsons] alten Freund King Davie gebracht, um drei Stämme, unter seinen Befehl, nach seinem Lager (Kuunaru am Hopkins) zu rufen. Der Kreis auf der flachen Seite zeigt dies Lager, und die Reihen von Einkerbungen bedeuten die auf jeder Seite herannahenden Männer. Die andere Seite ähnlich. Die Figur der Hand bedeutet eine Zusammenkunft, und die Zickzack Linien am einen Ende die Gegenwart des Häuptlings." (p. 193)    Translation: "The drawing is a reproduction of an original, brought by his [Mr. J. Dawson's] old friend King Davie in order to invite three clans he to his camp (Kuunaru on Hopkins). A circle on the flat side represents this camp, and the rows of notches stand for the men coming from each side. This applies to the other sides of the stick as well.

[JC 20 9 2000]    Research notes: This is possibly one of the object mentioned in a letter from Howitt [Howitt 10] of the Tylor papers PRM ms collections Box 12 of June 25 1883:     'Dear Dr Tylor Your letter of the 13th May reminds me that I have not yet sent the turndun which I promised in my last letter. The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net "yamma" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him. The old man showeed mine to my correspondent with much mystery after sending all the women away from the place    These are all the contributions which I can send you this time but more will follow as soon as I can get them drawn -- I do this because I cannot yet tell whether in the work for which I am gathering materials I may or may not require illustrations of these things. This will not however in any way affect any use to which you may decide to put them. They are yours to do with as you like. If there are any other blackfellows implements which you want I shall be delighted to try and obtain them for you.

A video about message sticks (2007)	 	Two-part video uploaded to YouTube by Ididjaustralia on 8 September 2007: "This is part 1 of Dha:wu'mirr Dharpa, a story about message sticks by Gumatj elder Andrew Galitju.    Part 1 and 2 of this story shows Galitju making message sticks. Galitju, Yirrirnirnba and Mirarra' provide commentary on how old people used these message sticks before telecommunications, paper, and air travel found their way to Arnhem Land.    For those interested in Yolngu language and culture, additional written comments will be added here in due time, to aid in your understanding of Yolngu grammatical structure as well as to expand your vocabulary.    A bit about Galitju... as well as making an appearance in the feature film Yolngu Boy, Andrew Galitju is known throughout Arnhem Land and the 'Top End' of the Northern Territory as a legendary hunter, cross-cultural educator, and all-round nice guy.    When I first met Galitju some 10 years ago, it was with Yolngu friends who paid him a visit in order to purchase turtle meat from his deep freezer. There is always a ready supply of magpie goose, stingray, fish, turtle and other culinary delights in Galitju's house!    Galitju is my "brother-in-law", father to yirdaki extraordinaire 'DJ' Burarrwanga, second father to George Rr*rr*mb*, and grandfather to Henry Mirarra' Burarrwanga."

The piece was collected around Lajamanu so it is safe to assume the language is Warlpiri   The stick was carried aboriginal's when they travelled and it's function was to let Aboriginal's know that they meant no harm and it was carried as a sign of good faith when travelling amongst other people's land.

On one side is a carving of a canoe in the water, & having a rough passage; on the other side is a drawing of tobacco & tucker. The meaning of the message is “We have just come from Melville island. The canoe is no good, it rocks too much. We have all been seasick. Send tucker & tobacco to Shoal Bay, our bellies are empty.”    The reason for the stick being shaped like a cone is to show that the sender had travelled in a canoe from the Island. The wavy lines in the canoe represent the sea-sick passengers; “Him belly jump about all same kangaroo”, explained the dusky gentleman who gave me the stick.    The marks are made by fire, & also by a sharp-pointed instrument, but the boy could not say whether it was a spear-point, a knife, or a piece of broken glass. I incline to the idea that it [is] made by the point of a spear. The straight lines represent tobacco; the other lines mean food; (tucker); “Might be damper, might be bread, might be bullock (beef), might be tea, sugar, him all about plenty hungry-fellow; canoe bin too much jump-about, him sick all same dog”.    The tiny scrap of string has no significance; it was merely used to fasten the stick to the boy’s waist-belt so that it should not be lost.

It looks like etching, and is done with a finely painted red-hot stick; it really is the newspaper of the district. You see the long strip of land, with its post and rail fence, or two or three rude houses which constitute the nucleus of what is going to be a great city, perhaps; or else there is an ummistakable bit of a harbour, and the fleet of pearlers is just coming in, with every sail set and a fair wind.There are some trees just indicated, men stand by an open grave, horses are picketed behind, and there is a rude cross in the corner, where a little clearing has been made to mark a former explorer's grave'.	 	 	 	254	23	5	Wood	Incised	 	Museum collection	Acquisition date: 1885	The British Museum	Oc,+.2424	Donated by: Sir Frederick Napier Broome	 	 	British Museum Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)	 	 	 	 	http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=509598&partId=1&searchText=message+stick&images=true&page=1	 	 	EOC5869	Additional IDs: Oc1885C2.2424-2425 (old CDMS no.)

Very few message sticks have reliable provenance information, so I'm very interested in the fact that that this one has a label on it at all.     Are you able to tell me:  -the circumstances of the previous collection put together in the 1960s/1970s  -the name of the linesman who collected it  -if the artefact has a protrusion at one end that indicates it may have been used as a woomerah ("biletta" is a synonym for spear-thrower)    I understand the need to protect privacy etc, so if the previous collection or family wants to contact me than can find me here:   http://www.shh.mpg.de/employees/48485/25522    Many thanks"  roni 3331 replied on 7 March 2017: "Hello,  thankyou for your interest in this piece.  Normally I would have had quite a few bids on the piece by now, but only have 2 watchers.  I think that with the beginning of the new year, less spending money and a lack of serious bidders out there, the best option would be for me to try listing this stick again at some other time     To answer your questions,   I cannot see any protruberance on either of the stick ends that would suggest any form of catapult ( woomera ), nor any resin traces that would have suggested some type of breech for a spear mount.    I was told at the time I bought several artifacts from the collection, that the original owner was elderly and retired.  He went back to his former homeland in Europe. The surname was pronounced Clews, Clews, Cloose...not sure about the spelling as the name was verbally stated.  These items were acquired at a dispersal sale through third parties, so I could not gather any more concrete information.    Sorry I could not have been more help.  regards, Roni."

Der Charakter seiner Zeichnungen erscheint etwas anders als der der Nanninestäbe; sie erinnern vielmehr, insbesondere durch ihre schematische Gleichheit, ziemlich auffallend an die Figuren auf den zentralaustralisch en Tschuringa." (Weule 1915, p. 48)  Translation OT: "Fig 4. in Table 1 is a sketch of a message stick collected at Ashburton River in West Australia, an area located rather far away from Nannine. The character of the drawings appears somewhat different from that of the Nannine sticks.

And one of their parents before them.  Some are catalogued with their provenance and some are not.  This came originally from one of my grandfathers collection so it would be at least early 20th century when it was collected. I'm 78 years old and my parents died a few years ago in their 90's.  All that was written on this was Western Desert WA and it was written in my grandfathers hand writing.  I'm sorry that I can't provide anything further.

Euthanasia message stick	parliament  interpreted_artefact  glossed_artefact  political  	Accompanying text reads: "This letter stick – ḏarpa dhāwumirri – is sent because it follows the ancient practice of our people – Yolŋu – when communicating with trading partners, in diplomatic alliances, or between Parliaments. This message is a special form of communication between the Parliaments of the Yolŋu Nation/States within East Arnhem Land, and the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia.   It contains within its markings, a reference to Māgaya, which is the responsibility of the Parliament to the citizens. Māgaya is the peace, order and good government afforded the people constitutionally under Customary Law in a manner similar to the Australian Constitution as stated in section 5l.  The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of the Northern Territory is seen as breaking these fundamental constitutional responsibilities placed upon the Parliament. Further, Yolŋu Customary Law – "Common Law" – defines the enactment of the Northern Territory Act as an illegal action of sorcery punishable at law.  For this reason this message endorses the action of Kevin Andrews MP to bring a Private Member's bill which will overturn the NT Act. Indeed, it is the sacred responsibility of this Parliament to do this.  This message urges the members of both houses to support the Bill's passage into legislation.

She wrote: "I figured out that the small waves at the end of the lines in picture one (4696/97) are hyphens. So If I’m not mistaken most of the missing words are actually just endings. The only words missing in the account of the shipwreck are what I interpret as “Ausfahrt”, “Herfahrt” and something illegible with the German ß at the end. Therefore, it might be something old I don’t know.As to picture two (4700), the sentence does not really make sense, especially the verb “trägt” but I’m almost certain my interpretation of the handwriting is correct in this case. Maybe the author himself left out a word."    Piers marked up location info (".... W. Australien) and material in far right column for review by Anneke H. She wrote in reply: "What I can say for certain is that the horizontal red circle to the right contains “cm lang Australien”. Which of course doesn’t make any sense. The “cm lang” is part of the description of the message stick (29,5cm long). The “Australien” may be the extension of the column to the right (vertical circle). Concerning the right circle I’d say the first word starts with a capital G and I would bet it continues over the next line because the next word starts with what looks like an h or f. There are not many German words this length starting with an h or f. It does look like “Gef-hart…horn” but that’s not even a word. I’ts very likely the passage end with “Carl Sahl in Sidney” but to be honest, without your hint I wouldn’t have read “Carl” because the ending is that blurry. What’s really interesting is the modern, not Sütterlin e in Sidney.     I can’t really make sense of the writing in the horizontal circle to the left containing W. Australia but noticed some oddities there as well. The hand writing looks different from the rest. First of all it’s written in pencil instead of ink. And the capital A looks different and a lot newer. It’s possible this was written later and by a different person. The numbers following the “W. Australien” look like this person referenced a different section or message stick. If you have the corresponding files “2582 u[nd] 2233/36” they might give you a hint on what the author tried to reference. And he had a terrible handwriting, that’s for sure."    Piers replied: "Thanks Anneke,   This is really useful. I had incorrectly guessed that "cm lang" was "sammlung"!    The crossreferences to other artefacts aren't usually helpful. Often they are preceded by "dgl." which stands for dergleichen and the comparison is usually on the basis of visual similarities rather than origins.    My bad guess for the words preceding W.Australien was something like "dorf__ W. Australien". There are very few settlements in the north west of Western Australia, where I suspect the artefact comes from, but the word doesn't like any village I know from that area. (In fact, I lived in that region for three years.)    Thanks again for taking the time with this,  Piers"    Anneke replied: "“Dorf” could be possible but the first letter is a little too small to pass for a capital D. Plus, the capital W and A are not written in Sütterlin style. Therefore it seems likely the author would have written a modern D as well. Yet again, this is just a wild guess. Said letter could also be “v” followed by “o” and… something “h”-ish. Maybe “f” but “h” seems more likely because the lower… how do you call that? Anyway, the lower part of the letter is not strait but bent.    In writing that I just realized the next word is most certainly “sicher”. What I first thought was “u” looks more like “i” followed by “c”. That would make “…h sicher W[est] Australien”. Does that make any sense?    And a minor addition to the part on the right (it seems I’m having way too much fun deciphering this): if the first two lines are still written in Sütterlin, the first word on the second line could be “herrn”. That would make “Ge…- herrn Carl Sahl in Sidney”. Again, all the letters in Sahl and Sidney look much more modern than the rest, so the two words in the beginning could contain a mixture of old and new letters. Anyway, I doubt that whatever is written there contains a specific location.    I hope that helps. If you come across another illegible passage, feel free to ask me!

Research notes: In Tylor papers PRM ms collections, Howitt 3 Howitt writes: 'In the matter of message sticks I have been at work for a long time. I have secured some which I will send to you. After I have made careful drawings of them for future use. I have not yet found one instance where the marks upon them convey any meaning by the blacks from which [insert] whom [end insert] they have been obtained. They say the marks are only for ornament and that the "stick" is more of a token to accredit the messenger. This does not disprove the positive statements made eg by Mr Dawson that in some places the marks have a meaning. So far I cannot find an instance either in South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales or Victoria. Message sticks were not known to or used by the Kurnai. The messenger sometimes carried a boomerang, shield or spear as a token from the sender of the message.' It is therefore possible that these message sticks came from Howitt to Tylor.    Letter 4: I must now explain the delay in procuring for you the humming instrument and the fire stick which you expressed a desire to obtain. I have now one tundun (Gippsland) one Bribbun (Queensland) and I expect shortly several others. [2] It is not however easy to procure these as the blackfellows dont like to give them up nor tell let white people see them. I have also a fire drilling apparatus from Queensland; I shall shortly have one belonging to the district and I am promised another from southern Queensland. I hope also to procure others. So soon as I obtain those or others, or find that the delay will be too long I shall send the collection off to you with further particulars.

It just says message stick. It looks like a cigar. Nora Pearce and June Simmons.’ Curatorial note: ‘Message stick, Australia. There was much discussion amongst anthropologists in the late nineteenth century about the use of message sticks in different parts of Australia. It was thought that they were widely used and would have served a range of functions such as signifiers of safe passage through new territories or as invitations. It has been suggested that the notches on the stick probably acted as reminders rather than as a language that could be read. Today they stand as an icon of Australian Aboriginal culture.

A message stick from Northern Territory held in the Museums Victoria	localised_artefact	Summary: "This unusual piece was made for Donald Thomson who described it as a 'minature on a piece of wood'. Thomson noted it was the 'second bark drawing' done on 14th July 1935, the other being a bark painting by Wuluwirr's father, the famous Djapu leader Wonggu Mununggurr. These were the first paintings collected by Thomson in Arnhem Land. This work is very unusual being a painted onto a piece of wood rather than a sheet of bark. It is similar in size and form to a 'letter stick' or message stick, the surface of which is usually incised rather than painted. Wuluwirr produced two further work on bark for Thomson, and all these are the only known paintings by this man who died before WW2."

Established in 1973, the first members of the AAB took the lead in promoting and supporting Aboriginal artists from across Australia, engaging the international community as well as the wider Australian population. During the 1970s, the members of the AAB increased the exposure of Aboriginal art internationally through an extensive program of exhibitions that were held in over 35 countries. Many of the artworks were gifted to the host countries at the conclusion of these exhibitions. Music sticks made by Bob Maldubal were amongst a significant exhibition collection gifted to the New Zealand government in 1976. His distinctive design is evident in the two pairs acquired by Museum Victoria.	Julia Bespamyatnykh	MV_Item_X_97722_01.png;MV_Item_X_97722_02.png;MV_Item_X_97722_03.png;MV_Item_X_97722_04.png

The stick is 11.5 cm long x 1.8 cm wide.    It has some damage on one side.  I have always wondered what the carvings meant.    My mother spoke with deep affection of her time in Tennant Creek at 103 Australian General Hospital (AGH) in 1942 during WW11.    Apart from soldiers I gather there were many Aboriginal patients including children.     I am hoping to gain a clearer picture this year - I gather many people were moved to Katherine and Tennant Creek after the bombing of Darwin.    Happily she met my father in Tennant Creek at that time also!

Murray Garde wrote on 6 August 2018: "A couple of months ago I was in Maningrida with a film crew recording some traditional stories from a husband and wife couple who are both artists [Bob Burruwal and Lena Yarinkura]. They told a nice story about fire drives, spirit beings and the invitations that go out to other groups to join in the kangaroo drives. They made a message stick to show us how people were invited to these events and we filmed them talking about the stick and its significance. One thing I could never really get anyone to explain however, is the meanings of the individual marks on the sticks and the repertoire of such marks and their meanings. We didn’t get to that level of analysis. I am supposed to be transcribing this material over the next couple of months, so I would be happy to send you a copy."

Description of Woiwurrung message stick communication 	text_reference	From Brough Smythe, R. 1878. The Aborigines of Victoria: With notes relating to the habits of natives of other parts of Australia and Tasmania. Vol. I. Melbourne & London: John Ferres. p133:     "When a [unspecified Victorian] tribe is encamped, it is not permitted to any other tribe to approach the camp without warning. Bent on revenge, or with an intent to murder, or for the purpose of stealing a young woman, a warrior will sometimes invade a camp in the night and seek to effect his purpose, but such enterprizes are not of very common occurrence. Whether for friendly intercourse or for war, the tribe which seeks a meeting must give notice of its coming in due form. A messenger (We-ar-garr), whose duty it is to proceed to the camp and state the intentions of the visitors, or to invite them to come to the camp of his tribe, is formally appointed by the principal man of the tribe, assisted by the old men in council. The young men are not allowed, under any circumstances, to take part in such deliberations as may be preliminary to so important a matter as a visit to or the reception of another tribe. On very solemn occasions two ambassadors or messengers are appointed; ordinarily, only one. The messenger has to carry a token, by virtue of which he passes safely through the lands of the several tribes. The token is a piece of wood, eight or ten inches in length, sometimes round and sometimes flat, and seldom more than one inch in thickness. On it are inscribed hieroglyphics which can be read and interpreted, and which notify all persons of the nature of the mission. If the mission is a friendly one, the stick is streaked mostly with red-ochre (Werrup); but if unfriendly, or for the purpose of demanding satisfaction for injuries done, or for war, then it is mostly streaked with white-ochre (Ngarrimbul). The principal man, in putting this stick into the hands of the messenger, and having named the tribe for which the invitation is intended, says, “You hold this now” (Koong-ak kinee Mirrambinerr). “Look out and find plenty of blackfellows” (Yane-wat benjer oonee kolen). “You tell all blackfellows to come here” (Toombooni boole-anin kolen-yan-an niool or Tom-buk U-mar-ko Koolin Ner-lin-go)." 	 	1878	terminus ante quem	 	Positive text reference	Chirila: Woiwurrung  Austlang: S36: Woiwurrung  Glottolog: woiw1237	 	 	On 30 August 2018, Barry Blake wrote to Piers Kelly: "The language is the language of the Melbourne area, which I was calling Woiwurrung. I hesitate only because I think Boonwurrung was pretty much the same.  These words come from William Thomas, who was stationed in the Dandenong area for some time, on the Woiwurrung-Boonwurrung border.    Wirrap and ngarrimbal are confirmed, and I can translate most of the sentences. I'm pretty rusty. If it is important, I could look harder at the sentences.

Reference to use of message sticks in the Herbert River area, from Carl Lumholtz	 	Lumholtz, Carl. 1892. Unter Menschenfressern : eine Vierjahrige reise in Australien. Hamburg: Artien-Gesellschaft.: "Die Stöcke sind ca. 10–15cm lang und 2–3 cm breit; einige sind flach, andere rund und oft mit verschiedenen Farben bemalt. Ich habe selbst bei Herbert River einen solchen Botenstrock gesehen, und der Schwarze Empfänger sagte mir, er verstände alles, was darauf stände, ging hin einen ähnlichen Stock zu fabriziren und rizte die Antwort hinein: gerade und trumme Linien, unregelmäßig und ungeordnent, wie die erhaltenen"     Lumholtz, Carl. 1889. Among cannibals: an account of four years' travels in Australia and of camp life with the aborigines of Queensland. New York: C. Scribner's Co.: "I myself saw one of these sticks which came to a native among my acquaintances on Herbert river. The man told me that he understood the inscription perfectly well, and he even prepared a similar stick, on which he wrote an answer."	 	 	 	 	Positive text reference	 	 	 	Lumholtz mentions message sticks in connection with the Herbert River. He stayed in the vicinity of Cardwell area for his fieldwork, which would suggest that Dyirbal is the best estimation for the linguistic area. 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	https://www.archive.org/stream/bub_gb_oJgLAQAAIAAJ?ref=ol#page/n9	https://archive.org/stream/amongcannibalsac1889lumh#page/302	 	 	Piers Kelly	00-Text_reference.png

A message stick in a private collection, first acquired by the explorer Lawrence Allen Wells in Western Australia or South Australia	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Richard Davies to Piers Kelly 28 November 2017:  "Lawrence Allen Wells was my great grandfather.    http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/wells-lawrence-allen-9043    I have shown pictures to University researchers in WA and they think that the stick came from the Mullewa/Geralton area, but it is guesswork. The stick may have come from from any of the WA areas he explored, and dates.... who knows.  I found the stick amongst my father's effects while he was very ill and close to death. I asked him about it but he couldn't even remember that he had it. I have bull roarers and boomerangs that Wells left to my dad. He had been given them by various Aboriginal people- probably in WA, though he did explore in SA until he was 73.    My wife and I have lived and worked with Aboriginal people for over 40 years in the NT. When I showed the stick to some of the Tennant Creek men they did not respond much. They would have told me had they any knowledge of such an object. We likewise have been given a plethora of artefacts from the Tennant Creek/Barkly Tableland region.    I have tried looking on the WWW for images of similar things but only found much cruder message sticks and so that is why I contacted you.    Thank you for responding to my email.    best wishes"    Piers Kelly replied: "Hi Richard,  How very interesting. I would say your great grandfather's message stick is plausibly from WA. It looks like others that I've seen from Western Australia at the Ethnologisches Museum in Berlin and at the National Museum of Australia. In a quick search of the database I've found this polished sandalwood style as far north Roebourne and as far south as Rottnest Island.     You will notice that this one (on the far right) from the British Museum is very similar and it's from the Murchison district: http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=505450&partId=1&searchText=message+stick&images=true&page=1    I can give you access to the message sticks database-in-progress if you like, but it still needs a lot of tidying up. Just let me know and I'll generate log-in details.    Would it be possible for me to include your artefact in the database too? It's certainly a fine piece of work, and other experts might have more to say about it than me.     All the best,    Piers  P.S. Do you remember which university researchers you contacted in WA? I would be keen to know if anybody else is working in the area of message sticks. "	Piers Kelly	2017-Davies_04a.jpg;2017-Davies_03.jpg;2017-Davies_01.jpg

"Hello again, the stick was owned by 'old Tim" a very elderly Aboriginal gentleman living near Boulia in North Qld, it was pasted down to him   via his family, I have, thru a second party, purchased over the years, a number of his/family pieces , mostly carved bone used in various  ritual, he told the story of its use in trading which was confirmed by Roth's writings and drawings.  regards,  David."

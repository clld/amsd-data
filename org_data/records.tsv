[ZM 14/02/2013]    This is probably one of the object mentioned in a letter from Howitt [Howitt 10] of the Tylor papers PRM ms collections Box 12 of June 25 1883:     'Dear Dr Tylor Your letter of the 13th May reminds me that I have not yet sent the turndun which I promised in my last letter. The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net "yamma" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him. The old man showeed mine to my correspondent with much mystery after sending all the women away from the place    These are all the contributions which I can send you this time but more will follow as soon as I can get them drawn -- I do this because I cannot yet tell whether in the work for which I am gathering materials I may or may not require illustrations of these things. This will not however in any way affect any use to which you may decide to put them. They are yours to do with as you like. If there are any other blackfellows implements which you want I shall be delighted to try and obtain them for you.

Howitt (1889)	interpreted_artefact  glossed_artefact  localized_artefact  tally_imprecise	Sketch of a message stick (fig. 13.) in Howitt's 'Notes on Australian message sticks' (1889), later reproduced as fig. 11 on p. 704 of "The native tribes of southeast Australia" (1904)	"a message stick used by the Mŭndainbŭra tribe at the Dawson River, in Queensland" (Howitt 1889, p. 325)	1889	terminus ante quem	 	Image of a message stick (artefact missing)	traditional	QLD	 	Chirila: Mandandanji  Austlang: D44: Mandandanji  Glottolog: mand1417	 	 	The message stick is associated with the “Mŭndainbŭra tribe, Queensland" (1889, p. 332); "the Mundainbura tribe of the Durham Downs in Queensland" (1904, p. 709)    Unable to identify 'Mundainbura' language of Queensland. In Thorpe (1909) 'Australian tribal names with their synonyms', 'Mundainbura' is noted as "North of Denham Range Queensland" which would place it in the vicinity of the Barna language. Other languages that match the general geographic vicinity are Wiri and Yambina.     However, in Howitt's text which ought to be considered more reliable, the message stick comes from the Dawson river (p. 325) which is further south, and his correspondent is from Durham Downs which would place the language in the vicinity of the Mandandanji language. This is closer to 'Mundainbura' given that -bura is typically a toponymic suffix in many Queensland languages. 	 	"My correspondent Mr. W. Logan, of Durham Downs, says of this stick as follows: "the notches in the upper edge represent a number of men of the Kūrgila class of the tribe. The two rows of dots below represent men respectively of the Kŭnbe and Wūngu classes. The notches on the lower edge represent men of the Kuburu class. The message with it was to invite these people to a corroboree." (p. 325)    In writing to a valued correspondent, Mr. R. Christison, of Lammermoor Station, on the subject of message sticks, I submitted to him a sketch of the Mundainbura message sticks with a request that he would ascertain what the men living with him of the Dalebura tribe could make of it; the Dalebura tribe has the same class divisions as those above noted.    In reply he wrote as follows: " I return the message you sent in your letter and I will explain all the blacks here can make of it. The top notches represent the Karagilla class; the bottom ones represent the Kooberoo class and the dots represent a wish to meet."  This statement is important as showing that the notches in the upper and lower edges have a definite meaning as the Kurgilla and Kuburu classes respectively." (Howitt 1889, p. 325)    "Fig. 13. Message stick of the Mundainbura tribe, Queensland, inviting to a corroboree. Upper line of notches represent men of the Kurgila clan, upper line of dots, men of the Kunbe clan, lower line of dots, men of the Wungu clan, and the lower line of notches men of the Kuburu clan. One-fourth scale." (p.332)    "The notches shown on the right-hand edge represent a number of men of the Kurgilla sub-class. The two rows of dots represent men respectively of the Kunbe and Wungu sub-classes. The notches on the left-hand edge represent men of the Kuburu sub-class. The message with it was to invite these people to a corrobboree.  I sent a sketch of the stick to a valued correspondent, Mr. R. Christison of Lammermoor Station, with a request that he would ascertain what the men of the Dalebura tribe, living with him, could make of it.  The Dalebura tribe has the same sub-classes as the Mundainbura tribe. In reply he informed me that his blacks made out the stick to mean, that the right-hand notches represent the Karagilla sub-class ; the left-hand the Kuburu sub-class, and the dots represent a wish to meet.  This statement shows that the notches in the right and  left-hand edges have a definite meaning as the Kurgilla and Kuburu sub-classes respectively."

It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message.

"The following instance will show how message sticks are used in this tribe, figs. 15 and 16, Plate XIV, represent one which was sent by one of the Wakelbura, to a member of the Yangebura tribe at Blackall.

The message refers to game, (a) being for Emu, (b) for Wallaby, to be found near a certain wire netting fence, (c) on a station near Clermont. The marks on the stick do not convey their meaning without a verbal message. The man who takes the stick explains their meaning. If the stick were sent by a Mallera, everything marked on the stick would be Mallera, and it would be delivered to a Mallera. But the above described and figured stick was sent by Obu to Obu.

(2) Message stick sent to me by Mr JF [insert] J.C. [end insert] Muirhead--used by the Wakelbura tribe. All message sticks are painted. This stick was sent by an Oboo of the Wakelbura to one of the Yangebura tribe (at Blackall). The wood is this of Bedyea tree--which belongs to the Wooltheroo class--of which Oboo is a subclass. The message refers to killing game found in a fenced paddock at Mr Wallaces station near Clermont. The game is Emu and Wallaby which are both of the Wooltheroo class and therefore claimed by Oboo and Wongoo. The messenger delivers a verbal message. The marks are according to Mr Muirhead as follows: [2 drawings, the first marked 'Wallaby' and 'Emu' besides the stripes of decoration, the 2nd drawing is annotated 'This indicates the wire fence at Kilcommon Station'] [2] [2] James C. Muirhead. Note that there is correspondence between Muirhead and Howitt at AIATSIS Howitt papers. I can find nothing else about him. Wallace's station refers to Donald Smith Wallace (1844-1900), and his station (Kilcommon?) near Clermont. He represented Clermont in the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1883-1888. [AP 06/02/2013]    In 1840 Isaac Reckitt rented a starch mill in hull, subsequently purchased in 1848, extending into other household products including washing blue, a bleaching agent. This became the family business Reckitt and Sons, which expanded into the overseas market, opening a business in Australia in 1886. There are examples of Australian Aboriginal material culture that use Reckitt's blue throughout Australia, including rock art at Nourlangie Rock, Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory.

The message stick is associated with the "Goodooga, on the Bokhara river, New South Wales", sent to "Belay at Tinanburra, on the Cuttaburra river, Queensland" (p. 293)    "Culgoa tribe" presumably refers to the people living on the Culgoa river, namely the Muruwari. Goodooga, the place it was manufactured, is also within the Muruwari area. The 'Tinanburra tribe' is possible also a division of Muruwari since Tinnenburra station was on the border between Muruwari, Badjiri, Gunu and Baridji.  	 	"When handing the stick to Belay, Imball told him that Nanee and his tribe wished to meet him (Belay) and his tribe on the Cudnappa river for the purpose of holding a corroboree. Imnball further explained to Belay the devices on the stick as follows, which will be better understood by referring to plate VII: Nanee (a) sent the message from the Bokhara river (b), by the hand of Imball (c), via the Birie (d), the Culgoa (e), and Cudnappa (f) rivers, to Belay (g); that the stick was dispatched at new moon (h), and Belay and his tribe are expected to be at Cudnappa river (f) at full moon (i); (j) represents a corroboree ground, and Belay understands from it that Nanee and his tribe are corroboreeing at the Bokhara river, which is their taorai, and, further, that on the meeting of the two tribes at full moon on the Cudnappa river a big corroboree will be held.   The messenger, Imball, is shown standing beside Belay, which conveys the meaning that he will remain with the latter until he and his tribe are ready to start for the place of meeting, and that he, the messenger, will accompany them thither. The route taken by Imball in going from Goodooga to Tinanburra is shown at (k)."

MS contributed the following: "I have looked up the information we have in the EMu collections database system regarding E032197:    It is currently listed as an unrestricted item, and is on internal loan to the AM’s Bayala Nura – Yarning Country exhibition, where it can be viewed.  There is very little information in the EMu record, with very brief reference to the register and large card entries. The next step would be liaising with the AM’s Archives & Records team to look up the register information. We may be able to have someone from the AM’s First Nations team do this archival search in-house and send through the relevant information to you.  All that is listed in the EMu record:  -“Carved tablet, ? Message stick, red pigment”  -“Queensland?” – so it seems that there is very little -provenance information available.  Registered at the AM in 1929.  -Donated by Miss G. Mathews – we could also check the vendor file, if available.

At each side of and below the human figure are a number of crosses, 34 in all, and below these are some straight and curved lines. There are ten notches, five on each side, nearly opposite to each other. The native stated that the stripes on the human figure mean that it is "got up" or painted for the corroboree. On the other side of the stick, figure 4, there are two groups of crosses, one containing four, the other six, or ten in all, similar to those on the front side. The remainder of the carving on this side consists of a number of devices of the yammunyamun pattern, made up of straight lines and curves. The notches[fn:1] and crosses on the stick are merely added for ornament." (p. 294)  [fn:1: 1 Having heard white men say that these notches indicate a certain number of blacks. I asked Mr J. E.

He writes: ”As requested by you, I hare made strict and careful inquiries in reference to the ‘nicks’ on the edges of the message-sticks, and as far as I can learn, they do not mean anything.

Here is the description of fig 7:    "Figure 7.--This is a message stick or token sent by a man of the Clark River tribe to one of the blacks at the Basalt river, Queensland. The messenger who brought it said it was a re- minder to the Bluff Downs natives to bring plenty of handkerchiefs and other fancy things when they next visited the first- mentioned tribe. The length of the stick is five inches and three-eighths and its diameter half an inch. It is simply a round piece of wood, without any paint upon it, marked all over in a somewhat similar manner to figure 12."  Compare Fig 12:  "Figure 12.-The message-stick here represented is n round  piece of wood, a little over half a n inch in diameter and six inches long, and is painted red.

(Mathews 1897).    It appears that Brewarra was a station on the Cuttuburra and in the vicinity of Brewarrina, per this article in Trove: http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-page147903     This article (http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article162818950) says "Leaving Brindingabba, we come to the property of the great millionaire, Mr. James Tyson, coming first to his  Brewarra station, having first watered our cattle at the well-known Muckageeroo waterhole, which is one of the principal holes on the Cuttaburra Creek. The extent of Mr. Tyson's holdings will be understood when I tell my readers that the cattle  can travel 100 miles without being blocked by a fence. I believe prior to the drought some 90,000 head of cattle were on the run, which includes Tinenburra, Brewarra, Maianoa.  Munjourie, and other out-stations; horses, too, are numbered by the thousand.    Another article (http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article158400844) places it "on the Lower Cuttaburra, joining the Queensland border fence".     Somebody online says that Brewarra Station was at Yantabulla https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/australiansurnamesgroup/outback-burial-place-t6838.html, and various articles on Trove confirm this proximity       However there are at least two other Brewarra stations.

Here is the description of fig 7:    "Figure 7.--This is a message stick or token sent by a man of the Clark River tribe to one of the blacks at the Basalt river, Queensland. The messenger who brought it said it was a re- minder to the Bluff Downs natives to bring plenty of handkerchiefs and other fancy things when they next visited the first- mentioned tribe. The length of the stick is five inches and three-eighths and its diameter half an inch. It is simply a round piece of wood, without any paint upon it, marked all over in a somewhat similar manner to figure 12."  Compare Fig 12:  "Figure 12.-The message-stick here represented is n round  piece of wood, a little over half a n inch in diameter and six inches long, and is painted red.

This estimate is based on the fact that the message stick was collected in the Gregory River District (which in 1918 encompassed Burktown and areas to the north and southwest). The term "muranda" for message stick might be traced. The closest match in the Chirila database is murrandu=stick in Mithaka (Glottolog: mith1236)	 	Hamlyn-Harris, p.23: "Its message is reputed to be somewhat as follows: -The bearer of the message is sent with another man for two gins (two notches: first notch, single virgin; second notch, widow would suffice), and intimates a big fight which is to take place as a display of dexterity (not tribal fight). Nine wommeras represented by diamonds, and six spears by lines, are sent together with relatives of girls in payment for the two gins. The track indicates the distance to be traversed."    Frank, p.340: "Von einem anderen interessanten Botenstab berichtet Hamlyn-Harris (42, S. 22-23). Derselbe stammt aus dem Gregory-Flußgebiet (nach A. Merton) und führt den eingeborenen Namen ,,Muranda". Er ist auf der ganzen Oberflache mit fein eingeritzten Zeichen bedeckt, die in Mustern angeordnet sind. Der Trager der Botschaft wurde mit einem anderen Mann um zwei Frauen gesandt, die durch zwei Kerben gekennzeichnet wurden. Die erste Kerbe bedeutete eine Jungfrau, die zweite eine Witwe. Die weiteren Zeichen deuten einen großen Scheinkampf an, der stattfinden sollte. Neun Keulen werden durch Rauten, 6 Speere durch gerade Linien dargestellt. Diese Waffen wurden den Verwandten der Frauen als Zahlung (Brautpreis?) angeboten."    Translation: "Hamlyn-Harris (42, S. 22-23) presents another interesting message stick. It was found close to Gregory Rivers (accordign to A. Merton) and is called "Muranda". Its entire surface is covered with symbols that are provided in samples. The bearer of the message stick was sent by a man and regarded two women. The first notch ment a young woman, the secon one ment a widow. The other symbols represented a battle that was going to take palce. Nine cubs were rendered with the help of rhombs, six spears were represented as straight lines.

Harald wrote: "For doculects that that referred to as Mirning or the like the  corresponding Glottolog variety can be either        Kalarko [kala1379] kba      Ngadjunmaya [ngad1258] nju    It's debatable whether there should be a separate variety with that name.  Mirning is also the name of a subgroup"    Claire wrote: "So it looks like Glottolog includes 2 western Mirning languages but not the eastern-most one around Eucla, since the term Ngatjumaya is specifically  for Western Mirning? I see in my tree I used "Mirniny", "Ngatjumaya" and  "Eucla", and a number of Noongar varieties; I didn't have data for inland  varieties."	 	"In figure 8 the cuts above F (fig. 9) are the aborigines at Ooldea. The long incision F is the Oooldea soak, while those below this symbol indicate unspecified individuals, as do the marks above symbol G.

The writer has in his possession a specimen which was made by Kaawirn Kuunawarn, the chief of the Kirræ Wuurong tribe, and which is a facsimile of a summons issued by him long ago to three tribes, to meet his own tribe at a favourite swamp and camping-place called Kuunawarn, on the east side of the River Hopkins, and represents their approach to his camp. In the centre of the flat side of the spear-thrower is a carved circle of about an inch and a quarter in diameter, which represents the camp of Kaawirn Kuunawarn. Near it are three notches on the edge of the stick, and two lines and two dots on the flat side, pointing to the camp, which form his signature ; and, at the hooked end of the stick, three lines in shape of the letter Z indicate his presence. Four rows of notches, extending from each end of the stick to the camp, indicate the numbers of individuals of the two tribes approaching from opposite directions. On the other side of the spear-thrower, in the centre, there are two circles of a smaller size, and pointing to them is a small, rudely carved figure of a hand—the word for ‘hand,’ munya, also means a ‘ meeting.’ From each end of the stick six lines of notches represent the numbers of individuals of other two tribes approaching from opposite directions. As each notch indicates an individual, there must have been a thousand at this meeting. Kaawirn Kuunawarn was then a very young chief ; and as he is now a man considerably over sixty years of age, the meeting must have been held immediately previous to the occupation of the country by the white man. Of those who attended it there are only four individuals now alive, viz., Kaawirn Kuunawarn, Jamie Ware, Jim Crow, and Helen Crow." (p73)<br/>  <br/>  Adolf Bastian: "Die Zeichnung ist ein Facsimile eines Originals, durch Ihren [Hr. J. Dawsons] alten Freund King Davie gebracht, um drei Stämme, unter seinen Befehl, nach seinem Lager (Kuunaru am Hopkins) zu rufen. Der Kreis auf der flachen Seite zeigt dies Lager, und die Reihen von Einkerbungen bedeuten die auf jeder Seite herannahenden Männer. Die andere Seite ähnlich. Die Figur der Hand bedeutet eine Zusammenkunft, und die Zickzack Linien am einen Ende die Gegenwart des Häuptlings." (p. 193)<br/>    Translation: "The drawing is a reproduction of an original, brought by his [Mr. J. Dawson's] old friend King Davie in order to invite three clans he to his camp (Kuunaru on Hopkins). A circle on the flat side represents this camp, and the rows of notches stand for the men coming from each side. This applies to the other sides of the stick as well. The silhouette of the hand represents the gathering and the zigzag lines at one end signal the attendance of the head." (Transl. Olena Tykhostup) <br/>    Frank writes: "So ist folgender Botenstab in drei Stammen in Gebrauch. Dawson übersetzt die Zeichen wie folgt: "... auf einer Seite sind Einschnitte, welche die Zahl der Stämme bezeichnen, die man erwartet, auf der anderen die Zahl der Männer, die er (der Sender) fordert" ... "Ein Speerwerfer als Botenstab von drei Stammen verstanden. Ein Häuptling zeigt seine Ankunft auf dem von seinem Stamm bevorzugten Sumpf und Versammlungsplatz, genannt Kuunawaru an der Ostküste des Hopkin-Flusses, an. <br/>  a) Das Feld von Kaawiru Kuunawaru. <br/>  b) Zeichen fur ein Lager. <br/>  c) Anwesenheit des Hauptlings an den angegebenen Platz. <br/>  d) Zahl der Individuen der beiden Stamme von entgegengesetzter Richtung kommend. <br/>  e) Zahl der Leute der zwei anderen Stamme.

Dawson translates the symbols as follows: "[...] on the one side there are the notches that represent the number of tribes, that are expected. On the other side there is the amount of men that he (the sender) asks for." [...] "The stick is recognized by three tribes. The chief announced his arrival to the swamps that belonged to his tribe, and to the gathering area called Kuunawaru on the East coast of the Hopkin River. <br/>  a) The field of Kaawiru Kuunawaru.<br/>  b) The drawing of the camp.<br/>  c) The presence of the chief in the mentioned area.<br/>  d) Number of people from both tribes coming from the opposite directions.<br/>  e) Number of people from two other tribes.

The collection was then housed in the "Museum Room" on the second floor. Dawson had requested a second floor be built to ensure his collection would not be kept in damp rooms. His will and probate papers show that he left his natural history  and native weapons collections to the Mechanics Institute Museum, all of which had been housed there for the past 7 years on his death in 1900.<br/>    Unfortunately the collection was broken up with a section transferred to the State School in 1936 and other items to the Higher Elementary School at some stage. The latter school was destroyed by fire in 1940 and the State School in 1965. All records etc were lost in both fires, and also the museum collections.<br/>    The Camperdown Historical Society was formed in 1960, firstly with no premises. A small ground floor room at the Mechanics Institute was then provided, with little display room. In 1984 the Town of Camperdown council provided our current premises which allow for a good amount of display space.  We have a small collection of aboriginal artefacts which mostly came from the collection of Dr Hope who looked after the Aboriginals at Buntingdale Mission near Birregurra. He was apparently given items in payment for his services. These were housed for some years at Chocolyn School (near Camperdown) until it closed. They were then stored by a local resident before gifting them to our Society.<br/>    We have double checked the items we have but unfortunately none resemble the description of the item you requested.<br/>    As you have deposited funds into our account but we are unable to help would you like photos of some of the items we do hold?  If you would like a refund please provide your bank account details.<br/>    One of our members and a regular volunteer is a GG Grand-daughter of James Dawson and custodian of family information but knows no more than I have written.<br/>    Sorry we could not be of more help.<br/>    Regards,<br/>    Maree Belyea<br/>  Secretary"  <br/>  PK: Note that Bastian (1881), writes: "Hr. J. Dawson, der dieses interessante Stück übersendet, schreibt ..." indicating that he sent the object to Bastian.

The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net "yamma" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him. The old man showeed mine to my correspondent with much mystery after sending all the women away from the place    These are all the contributions which I can send you this time but more will follow as soon as I can get them drawn -- I do this because I cannot yet tell whether in the work for which I am gathering materials I may or may not require illustrations of these things.

A Message Stick Interpreted" from "The Register" newspaper.    "Considerable interest has been aroused in Adelaide over the ability of David Unaipon, a full-blooded aboriginal, to explain in scientific terms the folklore of his people. An interview with Unaipon appeared in. The Register of 1 October 3. By way of expressing his appreciation, Mr. Unaipon presented to The Register the translation of a message stick, made for him by the native doctor who was to accompany him on his northern trip as interpreter.  This is the first time that a message stick has ever been translated for the white man's understanding. The message in question, of which a diagram is shown, contains; a war order from Warta Yunna, chief of all the surrounding minor chiefs. As the key indicated it gives all the surrounding tribes their marching orders, directing the routes by which they are to gather together at one central spot and prepare for battle. The angles show the points at which they are to. make smoke signals."  	Sender: "a native doctor"  Recipient: "Mr. Unaipon"	1925	terminus ante quem	 	Image of a message stick (artefact missing)	traditional	SA_unlocalisable	 	 	 	 	This is most likely in South Australia, since it was given to David Unaipon who provided the interpretation. It was made for him by "the native doctor who was to accompany [Unaipon] on his northern trip as interpreter".     There are at least three avenues of inquiry:    1) It would be worth finding out about Unaipon's northern trip, presumably this means north in relation to Adelaide where The Register was published. If the identity of the interpreter could be discovered this would help isolate the linguistic area associated with the message stick (Unaipon's own affiliation is Ngarrindjeri). The preceding article in the Register is here: http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64244883    PK contacted Tim Rowse on 27 August 2019, who suggested contacting Philip Jones.    Other ways to narrow the search would be to find these names of people "Warta Yunna", "Thumgara", "Kow Wona", "Mulgarra", "Quenra", "Mindala", "Bungala", "Matharoo", "Oora", "Kow Dull", "War Tura".     2) Identify the language used in the interpretation.  Special clues for the language are   thumgara=dew  kow wona= thunder cloud  oora = wild grass bark  kow dull= wild potato  wommena= boomerangs    In Chirila lexical dataset:  dew = cannot find equivalent to thumgara  thunder = koːɹanna or koːɹunna in Parnkala, koːɹoːna in Wirangu, koːnoː in Yalarrnga (too far away)  wild potato = cannot find equivalent to kow dull    wongela= boomerang on Barcoo river (Queensland or SA?)  wungela = boomerang in Yambina (too far away)  waŋala = boomerang in Yuwi  wunggela = boomerang in Blackall-Barcoo River (probably QLD)  woomera= boomerang according to 'Aboriginal Names of Places with their Meanings, etc' (this could just be a mistake since woomera is Eora word for spear-thrower, after which the place derives its name)    According to Curr boomerang is panketyi in Ngarrindjeri.    So far the best lead is Parnkala and the adjacent Wirungu language. However in the Barngala dictionary based on Clamor Wilhelm Schurmann returns:  dew = yarlda; boorgoo  thunder = goorrana  cloud=mabinya; malgoo; baloowara  boomerang = wadna [used in Port Lincoln only for killing fish]    3) Continuing from the above, of the 13 individuals mentioned in the interpretation, four have names that are glossed as nouns. This suggests that these might be totem names:  Thumgara (Dew)  Kow Wona (Thunder Cloud)   Chief Oora (wild grass bark)  Kow Dull (wild potato)    On this line of inquiry it might be worth looking at AustKin for totem systems north of Adelaide that include these names.     The name Matharoo could be a moiety name, per Arabana moiety matthurie (the other moiety is kirawara)	 	"The message in question, of which diagram is shown, contains a war order from Warta Yunna, chief of all the surrounding minor chiefs. As the key indicated it gives all the surrounding tribes their marching orders, directing the routes by which they are to gather together at one central spot and prepare for battle. The angles show the points at which they are to make smoke signals." [...]  "Key: 1, Chief Thumgara (Dew); 2, Kow Wona (Thunder Cloud); 3, Chief Mulgarra; 4, Chief Quenra; 5, Mlndala; 6, Bungala; 7, Chief Matharoo; 8, Chief Oora, wild grass bark; 9, Chief Warta Yunna, chief of all the surrounding minor chiefs.

A central hole is incised on each side.    NMA description: A drawing of both sides of 1985.0059.0398 includes explanation of its symbols. This explanation is reproduced here in full and the numbers refer to the different sides of this object:    "1. The Mulga and the Lachlan tribes are to meet at a given point to perform the sacred Bora ceremony. The Lachlan tribe having the longest distance to travel have 3 months (or moons) notice. The Mulga tribe is allowed 1 month and 1 week. Closer in clans have a corresponding lesser time.    2. These marks convey the details of the ceremony proposed. The particulars are known only to the Karadja "Wise Men" of the tribes."    Edmund Milne (1861-1917) was born in England and emigrated to Queensland with his parents 19 months later. He had had personal contact with Aboriginal people throughout his life, from when he was a small boy in Queensland and, from the late 1860s, in New South Wales. This contact may have led him to recording the names of Aboriginal people associated with particular objects in his collection, at a time when this was rarely done. Milne seems to have begun actively collecting Indigenous artefacts in the early 1880s and was still acquiring objects a few months before his death in 1917. His work with the NSW Railways (1876-1917) enabled him to meet a broad range of people who facilitated his collecting and associated activities like visiting Aboriginal sites. From at least the time he lived at Orange NSW (1906-1915), and later at Ryde (1915-1917), near to Sydney city, he displayed his collection at his home. In addition to a large collection of Aboriginal artefacts, Milne's collection included artefacts from the South Pacific and prehistoric implements from Egypt, France and England. In his will dated 12 December 1916, Milne bequeathed his 'Anthropological collection' to the 'first Federal Museum opened in the Federal Capital'. The collection remained at Ryde until early 1931 when it was acquired by the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. It remained there until the Institute's collections were transferred to the National Museum of Australia in 1985.

Elsewhere, Edmund Milne associates the Mulga tribe with Coronga Peak (see NMA object 1985.0059.0051), Yallock (see 1985.0059.0289), Cobar (see 1985.0059.0100) and Byrock (1985.0059.0333). On this basis the best approximation would be Ngiyambaa for the Mulga tribe.     Using John Oxley's journal of 1820, Milne sought out the desecrated burial site of a Lachlan 'chief' at 33°04'08.7"S 146°47'20.5"E, a site termed 'King's Grave' by the NSW Office of Environment & Heritage. Accordingly, 'Lachlan' most likely refers to Wiradjuri.	 	«Ngiyambaa and Wiradjuri people are summoned to meet at a ceremonial ground for a young men’s initiation ceremony. All participants will be expected to arrive at the full moon, three moons hence. The Wiradjuri group will set out earlier in order to cover a longer distance. The Ngiyambaa group being closer will set out later and arrive a the same point at the same time.»	 	 	sd_ceremony_law	85	20	 	Wood	 	 	Museum collection	 	The National Museum of Australia	1985.0059.0398	Edmund Milne collection  Date acquired by donor (Australian Institute of Anatomy) 1931	 	 	The National Museum of Australia	30°44'09.3"S	146°19'39.8"E	For Ngiyambaa, the default Google coordinates for Mulga creek are 30°44'09.3"S 146°19'39.8"E,  these happen lie between Byrock and Cobar.

These objects were all acquired by Read during his work at the Point McLeay mission (later known as Raukkan) in South Australia and the Warruwi (Warrawi) mission on South Goulburn Island, off the Arnhem Land coast, during the early twentieth century. The collection also includes some of the different types of glass slides which Read used in his missionay activities. Read (1875-1950) spent most of his adult life working on Aboriginal missions in different parts of Australia. He worked at the Point McLeay Mission from 1906 to 1911, 1914 to 1917, 1919 to 1925 and 1938 to 1945, and from 1925 to 1928 he worked at the Warruwi (Warrawi) Methodist mission. Read was also a keen photographer during these periods. Read's collection is significant as a rare assemblage of the diversity of Indigenous objects being made at the two missions in the early part of the twentieth century, including material made for sale. The significance of the collection is enhanced through it containing objects which are early examples of the coiled basketry technique introduced into Arnhem Land during the 1920s."

NMA1985_0209_0001	A message stick from Queensland in the National Museum of Australia	localized_artefact  named_creator  	Cylindrical, wooden shafted message stick with a pointed lower end and a tuft of emu feathers bound to the truncated end with fibre string, pigmented overall in geometric designs and dots on a white background.        The Dick and Lindsay Roughsey Collection comprises a cylindrical, wooden, message stick with a pointed lower end and a tuft of emu feathers bound with red fibre string. The surface of the message stick, painted by Mornington Island artists and brothers Dick and Lindsay Roughsey, is covered with goodwill symbols painted in black, yellow, red and white in geometric designs and lines, dots and dashes on a white background. It was presented to prominent scholar of Aboriginal studies, Dr F. D. McCarthy, in Canberra in 1972.    Although not universal throughout Aboriginal Australia, message sticks were used by many tribes, including Lardil people, for various reasons including the coordination of large socio-economic events, to summon others for initiation ceremonies, for hostile purposes or to convey messages relating to sickness or death. Traditional message or 'talking' sticks were made of soft wood, ornamented, carved and often painted bright colours, and marked in various ways with notches, dots, strokes, curves and geometric designs. Lardil artists and brothers, Dick (Goobalathaldin) and Lindsay (Burud), Roughsey, were prominent in reviving and preserving the art culture of the Lardil people which has a long history stemming from traditions of body painting and shows strong affinities to ceremonial designs stretching to Central Australia.

Accordign to NMA: "The Dick and Lindsay Roughsey Collection comprises a cylindrical, wooden, message stick with a pointed lower end and a tuft of emu feathers bound with red fibre string. The surface of the message stick, painted by Mornington Island artists and brothers Dick and Lindsay Roughsey, is covered with goodwill symbols painted in black, yellow, red and white in geometric designs and lines, dots and dashes on a white background. It was presented to prominentscholar of Aboriginal studies, Dr F. D. McCarthy, in Canberra in 1972. Although not universal throughout Aboriginal Australia, message sticks were used by many tribes, including Lardil people, for various reasons including the coordination of large socio-economic events, to summon others for initiation ceremonies, for hostile purposes or to convey messages relating to sickness or death. Traditional message or `talking’ sticks were made of soft wood, ornamented, carved and often painted bright colours, and marked in various ways with notches, dots, strokes, curves and geometric designs. Lardil artists and brothers, Dick (Goobalathaldin) and Lindsay (Burud), Roughsey, were prominent in reviving and preserving the art culture of the Lardil people which has a long history stemming from traditions of body painting and shows strong affinities to ceremonial designs stretching to Central Australia. Beginning with bark painting, inspired by his visits to Arnhem Land in the 1950s, Dick Roughsey, OBE, went on to become internationally renowned for his children's books and remains one of Australia’s most significant artists. His talented older brother Lindsay, also known as 'Spider', was a source of inspiration to younger artists and at the heart of the history of Lardil painting from the early 1960s until his death in 2007."

GALITJU2007	A video about message sticks (2007)	arnhem_land  localized_artefact  named_creator	Two-part video uploaded to YouTube by Guan Lim (Ididjaustralia) on 8 September 2007: "This is part 1 of Dha:wu'mirr Dharpa, a story about message sticks by Gumatj elder Andrew Galitju.    From Guan Lim: "Part 1 and 2 of this story shows Galitju making message sticks. Galitju, Yirrirnirnba and Mirarra' provide commentary on how old people used these message sticks before telecommunications, paper, and air travel found their way to Arnhem Land.      A bit about Galitju... as well as making an appearance in the feature film Yolngu Boy, Andrew Galitju is known throughout Arnhem Land and the 'Top End' of the Northern Territory as a legendary hunter, cross-cultural educator, and all-round nice guy.    When I first met Galitju some 10 years ago, it was with Yolngu friends who paid him a visit in order to purchase turtle meat from his deep freezer. There is always a ready supply of magpie goose, stingray, fish, turtle and other culinary delights in Galitju's house!    Galitju is my "brother-in-law", father to yirdaki extraordinaire 'DJ' Burarrwanga, second father to George Rr*rr*mb*, and grandfather to Henry Mirarra' Burarrwanga."

The piece was collected around Lajamanu so it is safe to assume the language is Warlpiri   The stick was carried aboriginal's when they travelled and it's function was to let Aboriginal's know that they meant no harm and it was carried as a sign of good faith when travelling amongst other people's land.

 	A message stick listed for sale	interesting	This message stick was chosen for the front page of the Australian Message Stick Database for an unusual reason: we know almost nothing about it.    Message sticks are found in museums and archives but they also circulate among private sellers and collectors. Sadly, the histories of these objects are often not recorded or poorly maintained. Auction houses, for example, will not even reveal the names of their owners or previous owners for privacy reasons so stories and connections are quickly lost.     The AMSD is keeping track of message sticks that are sold and resold in order to trace their movements. We also hope that by posting the images from these sales, interested members of the public might recognise the objects and help us contextualise them.     This message stick was apparently collected in the Northern Territory in the 1950s. If you own it, or have previously owned it, please get in contact.

Undiscovered Australia: Being an account of an expedition to tropical Australia to collect specimens of the rarer native fauna for the British Museum, 1923-1925. London: Benn.    "One day during the wet season [1924-1925] a messenger arrived from a camp where a canoe was being cut for the [Milingimbi] Mission Station. He brought a message and delivered a letter-stick shaped like a cricket bat and marked with various carvings. The carvings were not by any means an attempt at calligraphy, but the stick was carried as a token of good faith, as messengers in other countries carry signet rings and other tokens. It was also an aid to a system of mnemonics practised by the tribe to which the man belonged. This messenger held the stick in his hand while he delivered the message, but he did not indicate the meaning of the signs until he was asked to do so. There were ten cuts to represent tobacco, and he could not very well ask for more and pocket the difference, as he might have done without the stick.     Each letter-stick is usually signed, for every native can make a mark by which the tribe may recognize him. The black boys whom I had with me left on several [234] occasions some tobacco at a temporarily deserted native camp, and in each instance they left some mark on the sand or carving on a stick, and on being asked what it meant, they would say, “That one name belonga ma.”[sic] Micky, a native, arrived at the station with a new canoe a few days before Christmas, and at our first meeting he proudly introduced himself and volunteered information that left no doubt as to his identity. “Me Micky,” he said. “Me bin longa gaol five years. Me savvee everything now, whisky, missionary, white missus ben see-em that pfeller picture. All about savvee everything.” Micky was the sender of the letter-stick referred to, and was one of the men who had served a term of five years’ imprisonment in the Darwin gaol for being suspected of the murder of some foreign fishermen at one of the Crocodile Islands. He consistently pleaded not guilty, and later the real murderer confessed his crime, but the confession did not reach the ears of the officials at Port Darwin. Micky and his companions had served the full length of sentence and gloried in the fact. They were innocent, and they had suffered for the guilty, but they did not mind and were proud of the knowledge thus gained." p235  	Micky	1925	terminus ante quem  	 	Message stick in a collection	traditional	NT	TopEnd_arnhem_east	Chirila: Yan-nhangu  Austlang: N72: Yan-nhangu  Glottolog: yann1237  	 	 	The message stick is associated with Crocodile Islands, NT, Australia	 	Requesting payment for the construction of a canoe on behalf of missionaries at Milingimbi	 	 	 	180	40	13	Wood	Pigmented, incised	 	Museum collection	Acquisition date: 1925	The British Museum	Oc1925,1113.49	Transferred from: Natural History Museum   Field Collection by: Wilkins, Sir George Hubert  Field Collection by: The British Museum 	 	 	The British Museum  British Museum Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)	12°06'12.8"S 	134°54'39.4"E	Absolute coordinates for Milingimbi Mission	http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=499556&partId=1&searchText=message+stick&images=true&page=1	 	 	EOC16241	 	PK: No more images to request from BM  PK wrote to LK of Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center on 30 May 2023 requesting additional metadata for the "Letter stick" listed by Wilkins in his "Provisional and Preliminary Report" of January 1925.

PK from MAGNT wrote back: "I have gone and looked through all our Fannie Bay Gaol records that date before 1919. Only one, a ledger from 1888-1913, has the name Mickey. This Mickey was convicted on 15 January 1906 before being released on 5 November 1909. This ledger only records long term inmates sentenced to 6+ months of hard labour and only provides their name, time spent and when discharged. I have attached the photographs of the pages at the beginning and end of his sentence as well as a spreadsheet I created with all the names mentioned in that book in case he had an alias or was known by another name. In those records there wasn’t a Caramel and the above mentioned was the only “Mickey” (of any spelling) but there were some Michaels.    Fannie Bay Gaol was used by the army in WWII after the bombing of Darwin and many of the records and objects were ‘souvenired’, so we only have a patchy collection of material that has been donated to the museum.    I would recommend getting in contact with LANT (Library & Archives NT) if you haven’t already to see if they have any other records that might help your research.    We would be very interested to know the outcome of your work and specially anything you find out about him!"

The non-etched transverse lines on the timber may indicate that it is a non-native species of wood.

Magnet road; in the west it approached the coastal highway and in the east it extended to around Mileura Station (Marmion 1996:2). North to the hills overlooking the head of the Lyons River, Teano Range, Mount Isabella, Waldburg Range; on upper Gascoyne River west of Three Rivers; at Erivilla and Milgun; south to Cheangwa and the Roderick and upper Sanford rivers (Tindale 1974). ... along the upper reaches of the Murchison river, from around Yallalong Station in the west, to near Meekatharra in the east, from north of Mt Augustus, to south of Talarang Peak (sic, gazetted as Tallering Peak) (Mackman 2011:231). ")      Yingkarta: ("Dench (1979) and O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966) say the language has a northern and southern dialect. Austin names the dialects as Manthi and Thirrily. Tindale locates Mandi (Manthi) at Carnarvon, on the lower Gascoyne River from Doorawarrah to the sea, south to near Grey Point, north only to the southern part of Boolathanna. Tindale locates Tedei (Thirrily) at the eastern coast of Shark Bay and valley of the Wooramal River from the coast north of Yarringa, north only to Pimbie, Carey Downs, and the south of Towrana (WA Handbook). the Yingkarta (Inggarda) territory is far too large and extends east of where it should be - the limit was Gascoyne Junction and the Lyons River (Austin in Sutton 1995:97). The territory occupied by the Yingakarta people extended from the coast at the northern end of Shark Bay between the Gascoyne and Wooramel rivers, along the rivers inland to Red Hill and Gascoyne Junction (Dench 1998:5).")    Warriyangga: ("Upper Lyons River, also Gifford and Minnie creeks; on Minnie Creek Station, at Edmund and the eastern side of Maroonah (Tindale 1974). Malgaru: East of Kennedy Range and in the hills east of Lyons River from Gascoyne Junction north to near Minnie Creek; at Eudamullah; south to near Fossil Hill (Tindale 1974). Warriyangka country was from Edmund south along the Lyons River, not nearly as far north as Davis (1993) indicates (Austin in Sutton 1995:97).")

This is mostly in the Ganalbingu linguistic area. However, note that in the SAM register the 'Purchased Tribe' is listed as 'Katji'.     Katji refers to a place and is not an ethnonym. In Peterson, Nicolas. 1976. "Mortuary customs of Northeast Arnhem Land: An account compiled from Donald Thomson’s fieldnotes."  Memoirs of the National Museum of Victoria 37:97-108, there is a quotation from a report: "While at Katji [on the mainland south of Milingimbi] camp in January 1937 Thomson noticed red blazes on the trees along the path to Derby Creek. These were to free the area about the Katji River from a restriction that had been imposed at the death of an important man.". A herpetology report (https://biocache.ala.org.au/occurrences/85b6a616-2ca6-48fb-bddb-317dbaf3a430) gives coordinates for a 'Katji Lagoon' as: -12.35, 134.78, which is near a 'Gatji Rd'. Gatji is also the name of a homeland (https://bushtel.nt.gov.au/profile/507) at -12.273, 134.82.    In the Bawinanga Aboriginal Corporation Annual Report 2016-2017, Gatji is mapped as being in the Wurlaki/Djinang (synonyms) area which also encompasses Ramingining and east to the mouth of the Glyde River.     Thus the best estimation so far is that the cultural owners are in the Wurlaki/Djinang speaking area, but a better consultation of Shepherdson's diaries could place it in the Ganalbingu area   (Chirila: Ganalbingu  Austlang: N83: Ganhalpuyngu  Glottolog: gana1269)    	 	Message stick was sent by native men asking for tobacco and calico in exchange for cypress pine trees felled.

More accurate annotations are found in the sketch within the register.     The collector is Harold Urquhart Shepherdson and the museum has a number of archives relevant to him: https://www.samuseum.sa.gov.au/collection/archives/provenances/aa320 It would be worth checking records prior to the accession date of 31 March, 1931. Further context might be gleaned by paying attention to all the other objects accessioned from Shepherdson in the same lot from Elcho Island, Crocodile Island and Castlereagh Bay from 'Kopapingu' and 'Katji' peoples.      It would also be worth consulting this book: Shepherdson, Ella. 1981. Half a century in Arnhem Land. One Tree Hill, S.A.: Ella and Harold Shepherdson.

Could also be Wirangu or any number of languages that met at the Ooldea Mission station    The "Ooldea tribe" is nonetheless analysed as Mirniny. (Note, however, that Mirniny turns up twice in Chirila. One is over on the western edge of the Nullabor near Caiguna. The other is further east near Eucla. The Eucla Mirniny is the one referred to here.)  We have assumed that "Ooldea tribe" is (eastern) Mirniny on the basis of the fact that the Ooldea soak is in this area at 30°24'29.0"S 131°49'42.0"E and the mission settlement is here: 30° 27′ 32.9″ S, 131° 50′ 8.21″ E.  Tindale also refers to "Miming man of Ooldea who went to Esperance by train and found friendly southern people there". Note that the Ooldea settlement was used as a base for constructing the railroad.     Harald wrote: "For doculects that that referred to as Mirning or the like the  corresponding Glottolog variety can be either        Kalarko [kala1379] kba      Ngadjunmaya [ngad1258] nju    It's debatable whether there should be a separate variety with that name.

Recommended for purchase – data with specimens is very good. —W. Tindale Ethnologist    PK: It's not certain that "arleedie" really is the word for message stick. SAM records put things in the description field that are sometimes words for message but can also be referring to the sender or something depicted on the stick. Not sure if Mirniny is really a language that has vowel-initial words either, so the realisation could be something like yalityi or waliti. Note that the Chirila database records 'arlart' as a term for message stick in Alyawarr. This would explain vowel-initial term but Alyawarr is too far away. Note also that aliti is a Pitjantjatjara/Yankunytjatjara term for prickly wattle (Acacia victoriae), so this could conceivably be referring to the species of wood that the object is made of.      PK 30.01.24: Possible that this is incorrectly labelled as 'restricted' in SAM database. PK to ask SAM for evidence of consultation for this status.

Although he has spears, spear-thrower and a knowledge of fire, his diet consists only of wild honey and the flesh of bandicoots, goannas and echidnas.  Plate 51B is a picture of Buma-buma. The artist has indicated the ribs and the backbone. The feet are shown as footprints.". This image might be compared to the message stick.

This is where Mr Lewsey was in 1914:   http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article196798986    Thus, he was in charge of the line camp at Yardea in 1914, having come from Port Pirie.

Message stick is conjectured to depict 'the construction of the Overland Telegraph Line between Eucla and Pt Augusta'. Label attached adds 'indicates the five tents of the construction gang'. It is perhaps more likely to represent work on the telegraph line between Port Augusta and Eucla between 1908 and 1914.

How acquired: Don[ation] 20 Dec [19]90 South Australian History Trust (ex Pioneer Village, Hackham). Label received with object also says "indicates the five tents of the construction gang. Purchased from a member of the tribe in 1914 by Mr A. H. Lewsey in charge of line camp."    NOTE: Some questions about this object – if it is a contemporary depiction of the construction of the OLT then it would date to 1870-1872 and held by the community until 1914 when it was sold to Lewsey.     Further, the OLT did not go between Port Augusta and Eucla (as far as I can tell). Note also that the stick appears to depict a railroad rather than a telegraph.     A working hypothesis: H. A. Lewsey was a 'line manager' of the Trans-Australian Railroad between Port Augusta and Eucla, in the period prior to 1914. The railroad was completed in 1917. Alternatively, he was a line manager of a telegraph (not the OLT) constructed or maintained along the railroad between Port Augusta and Eucla.      On 19 July 2022 PK contacted the History Trust of South Australia with the following question:  "Dear History Trust of South Australia,  In December 1990 you donated a message stick to the South Australian Museum (A-69467). This object was once part of the Pioneer Village Hackham and according to the register the label received with object says "indicates the five tents of the construction gang. Purchased from a member of the tribe in 1914 by Mr A. H. Lewsey in charge of line camp." This is a long shot but I was hoping somebody might be able to identify Mr A. H. Lewsey from other sources, and perhaps clarify 'line camp'. Construction of railway line? In what period? If anyone has any expertise I would be very glad to hear it. I am trying to propose a museum exhibition and would like to find out as much as possible about the context. Piers"    On 26 July 2022, Jacinta Koolmatrie replied: "Hi Piers,      Thanks for getting in touch. I wanted to know what research you had already done before I looked further into this to understand more about what you’re looking for.    Would you be able to let me know what information the South Australian Museum have provided to you and what independent research you have done?       Thanks,  Jacinta."    On the same date PK replied: "Thanks Jacinta,  The sum total of my research is as follows:  Consultation of the original hardcopy registers of the South Australian Museum and a search through the museum correspondence. This has yielded only the original accession record dated 18 Feb 1991, which is now attached and relevant detail outlined in pink.  Various search terms in NLA's Trove of 'Lewsey' in combination with regions and details mentioned in this record with no success  Everything I know is thus contained in the details I sent earlier.     If you can point me to an expert, archive or resource that would be fantastic.    Piers "    On the same day Jacinta replied: "Hi Piers,    Thanks, that helps to know. I have looked through our registers to see if we ever accessioned it and we didn’t, which leads me to believe we immediately gave it to the South Australian Museum. I have also looked through our database to determine whether we have more donations related to Lewsey and we do not.    I imagine the line camp is referring to the east-west telegraph line seeing as it’s referring to Port Augusta and Eucla. I believe you may be able to get some help through the state library if you haven’t already been in contact with them. They have a lot of material related to the telegraph line that could be useful.     Sorry I wasn’t able to be of more help. Hopefully you are able to get some more context.    Jacinta."    On 03.08.2022 PK wrote to GS of the National Railway Museum in Port Adelaide:    "Dear G,   I am a researcher at the University of New England, inquiring into the origin and significance of a message stick at the South Australian Museum. The message stick purportedly depicts a railroad and a rail gang construction camp, and it refers either to the railway line between Port Augusta and Eucla, or a telegraph line between those two settlements. There is only one clue: the museum register says "Message-stick, inscribed with story 'of the construction of the overland telegraph line between Eucla and Pt Augusta'. Purchased from a member of the tribe in 1914 by Mr A. H. Lewsey in charge of line camp." The problem is that the Overland Telegraph was completed in the 1870s and it never went between Port Augusta and Eucla. There is also no depiction of a telegraph on the object but there is a depiction of a railroad. Accordingly, A. H. Lewsey may have been in charge of a *railway* 'line camp' in this period. Can you recommend a resource for finding a certain A. H. Lewsey in rail construction or maintenance records from 1914 and prior? Many thanks for any leads.  Piers "  08.08.2022:  "Good afternoon Piers,    Thank you for your enquiry. Unfortunately we don't have anything on A. H. Lewsey here, if he was employed by the railways though you could check with the State Records of South Australia as they have the personnel records.    I've cc'd our Archives Assistant, who will investigate if we have any maintenance records from this period. State Records of South Australia may be able to assist you with this as well.    Kind regards,    Gabrielle Sexton  Curator and Business Manager (Mon-Fri 8am-4pm)"    Update on 9 August 2022:  Record that an "A H Lewsey" was employed as a Lineman by the Post-Master General's department from at least 1908.

YN1996	Euthanasia message stick	interpreted_artefact  glossed_artefact  localized_artefact  political  arnhem_land  parliament	Accompanying text reads: "This letter stick – ḏarpa dhāwumirri – is sent because it follows the ancient practice of our people – Yolŋu – when communicating with trading partners, in diplomatic alliances, or between Parliaments. This message is a special form of communication between the Parliaments of the Yolŋu Nation/States within East Arnhem Land, and the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia.   It contains within its markings, a reference to Māgaya, which is the responsibility of the Parliament to the citizens. Māgaya is the peace, order and good government afforded the people constitutionally under Customary Law in a manner similar to the Australian Constitution as stated in section 5l.  The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of the Northern Territory is seen as breaking these fundamental constitutional responsibilities placed upon the Parliament. Further, Yolŋu Customary Law – "Common Law" – defines the enactment of the Northern Territory Act as an illegal action of sorcery punishable at law.  For this reason this message endorses the action of Kevin Andrews MP to bring a Private Member's bill which will overturn the NT Act. Indeed, it is the sacred responsibility of this Parliament to do this.  This message urges the members of both houses to support the Bill's passage into legislation. Sent from Arnhem Land on 7th day of August 1996."

NJIMINJUMA1980	Message stick created by Jimmy Njiminjuma regarding vehicle trespass	interpreted_artefact  localized_artefact  named_creator	Jon Altman 29.01.24: : In April/May 1980 there was a lot of talk about upgrading the vehicle track between the East Alligator and Maningrida which passes by Mumeka    There was much opposition to this    There were also some NT government road crews coming through.    Back then people were pretty paranoid about mining and desecration of sacred sites.    And road access was linked to land rights law that purported to give people freehold title to their land but maintain previously ‘gazetted’ roads.    And they had moved to outstations for some peace and quiet.    So there were disturbed by this possibility that never eventuated all the effort going into the Arnhem ‘Highway’ between Katherine and Gove.

I've just been putting some of the finishing touches on an article about the message stick database and it's prompting me to ask if you can photograph Jimmy Njiminjuma's message stick about vehicle trespass when you get the chance. If you remember any more of the context that would also be fantastic.    In the meantime, can you estimate the year he made it? The most recent 'traditional' message sticks in the database are from 1979-1980 from Betty Meehan, so this would also correspond with your fieldwork period.     All the best,  Piers    P.S. Your AIATSIS photos of Jimmy making message sticks are below and they are dated June 1980:"    Jon replied on 28 January 2024:   "Hi Piers    That date is likely correct June 1980 although actual photo may have been taken in May    Happy for you to use it, Jimmy the creator of the message stick passed away in 2004    All the best    Jon"    PK replied on same day:  "Thanks Jon,  Is this specific message stick the one about vehicle trespass that you mentioned in your email of 27 September 2017? If so do you have any more contextual details about that incident? And is the artefact itself in Melbourne?    Sorry to pester! Since this represents a relatively recent use of message sticks in the Top End I'm especially interested.     Cheers,  Piers"  Jon replied on 29 Jan:  "Hi Piers    Yes that is the one    And yes it is in my possession    In April/May 1980 there was a lot of talk about upgrading the vehicle track between the East Alligator and Maningrida which passes by Mumeka    There was much opposition to this    There were also some NT government road crews coming through    Back then people were pretty paranoid about mining and desecration of sacred sites    And road access was linked to land rights law that purported to give people freehold title to their land but maintain previously ‘gazetted’ roads    And they had moved to outstations for some peace and quiet    So there were disturbed by this possibility that never eventuated all the effort going into the Arnhem ‘Highway’ between Katherine and Gove    There are entries in my field diaries also help by AIATSIS about this, see reference to a meeting in entries 18 and 19 May 1980    Hope this helps    Cheers"  	Piers Kelly  Nitzan Rotman	NJIMINJUMA1980.jpg;ALTMAN_J01_BW_N03214_23.jpg;ALTMAN_J01_BW_N03214_26.jpg

Bastian writes: "Rein zufällig war jedenfalls die Beobachtung, soweit sie mich angeht. Durch einen Zufall gewissermaassen gelangte ich nach Cooktown, durch einen Zufall wurde ich einige Tage dort aufgehalten, und durch einen Zufall wieder kam ich mit einem der dortigen Bewohner in ein Gespräch, in dessen Laufe ich durch eine zufällige Neben-[240]-bemerkung aufmerksam wurde und zum Weiterfragen veranlasste. Zuesrt hörte ich in Gesellschaft mit Hrn. St. Georges, dem Police-Magistrate, und einem alten Colonisten, dem Australien seine zweite Heimath geworden war, von dem ausgedehnten System von Signale sprechen, wodurch sich die australischen Stämme (besonders am Dawson) auf weite Entfernung hin verständlich zu machen wüssten, von den in Bäumen eingeschnitzten Zeichen (ähnlich den in Höhlen angetroffenen  Malereien), von Verzierungsformen u. dergl., und dann wurden auch einander zugeschickte Briefe erwähnt. Ich hielt dies mehr für eine Facon de parler und konnte an demselben Abend, wo ich von einer Erkundigung auf die andere geführt wurde, nicht wieder darauf zurückkommen. Am nächsten Morgen traf ich mit einem Sergeanten der sog. Black Police (gleich den meisten Offizieren dieses trefflich organisierten Corps über die Eingebornen wohlunterrichtet) zusammen, und als ich das Gespräch auf denselben Gegenstand brachte, erhielt ich zu meiner Verwunderung  nicht die halb und halb erwartete Widerlegung, sondern eine Bestätigung. Genauere Erklärungen, auf welche ich jetzt einzugehen suchte, konnte mein Gewährsmann mir leider nicht geben, versprach mir jedoch bei einem seiner Leute, der mit allem Dahingehörigen gut bekannt sei, als Dolmetscher zu deinen, sobald er aus der Station nach der Stadt kommen würde. Hier war ein Dilemma. Die Station war ziemlich entfernt, der Dampfer, den ich bei meinem genau berechneten Reiseplan nicht versäumen durfte, war bereits eingelaufen und konnte jeden Augenblick zur Wiederabfahrt fertig sein. Dabei war ich durch das Verpacken einiger am Platze erlangter Sammlungsgegenstände beansprucht und auch noch durch andere Besorgungen. Ein freier Moment musste indess geschaffen werden, worin ich mich nach dem in der Vorstadt gelegenen Polizeiposten begab und dort einen schwarzen Unteroffizier ausfindig machte, der zu den Intelligenteren seines Gleichen gehörte. Freilich war sein specifisch-australisches Pidgeon-English mit so vielen technischen Wendungen durchwebt, dass das Verständniss allerei Hin- und Herfragen erforderte. Damit gingen viele Minuten verloren, und doch andere, bis richtig aufgefasst war, was ich eigentlich wolle, dann war das Holz zu beschaffen (und zwar die für Kerben geeignete Art), dann ein Messer, was, wie immer in solchen Fällen (wenn es auf Eile ankommt), gerade nicht bei der Hand war, darauf der Brief zu schreiben oder zu schneiden, ferner zu erklären – und für das Ganze blieb mir kaum eine halbe Stunde. Ich fühlte mich deshalb von dem Resultat auch im Grunde nur wenig befriedigt, und unzufrieden mit mir selbst, da über mehrere der Cautelen, die gerade bei einer Untersuchung so hochwichtiger Art auf das Strengste hätten festgehalten werden müssen, allzu leicht fortgeschlüpft war, von dem Ticken der Taschenuhr gedrängt. Indess, wie die Sachen lagen, mussten sie gelassen werden, und mir blieb nichts übrig, als mich einzuschiffen."

She wrote: "I figured out that the small waves at the end of the lines in picture one (4696/97) are hyphens. So If I’m not mistaken most of the missing words are actually just endings. The only words missing in the account of the shipwreck are what I interpret as “Ausfahrt”, “Herfahrt” and something illegible with the German ß at the end. Therefore, it might be something old I don’t know.As to picture two (4700), the sentence does not really make sense, especially the verb “trägt” but I’m almost certain my interpretation of the handwriting is correct in this case. Maybe the author himself left out a word."    Piers marked up location info (".... W. Australien) and material in far right column for review by Anneke H. She wrote in reply: "What I can say for certain is that the horizontal red circle to the right contains “cm lang Australien”. Which of course doesn’t make any sense. The “cm lang” is part of the description of the message stick (29,5cm long). The “Australien” may be the extension of the column to the right (vertical circle). Concerning the right circle I’d say the first word starts with a capital G and I would bet it continues over the next line because the next word starts with what looks like an h or f. There are not many German words this length starting with an h or f. It does look like “Gef-hart…horn” but that’s not even a word. I’ts very likely the passage end with “Carl Sahl in Sidney” but to be honest, without your hint I wouldn’t have read “Carl” because the ending is that blurry. What’s really interesting is the modern, not Sütterlin e in Sidney.     I can’t really make sense of the writing in the horizontal circle to the left containing W. Australia but noticed some oddities there as well. The hand writing looks different from the rest. First of all it’s written in pencil instead of ink. And the capital A looks different and a lot newer. It’s possible this was written later and by a different person. The numbers following the “W. Australien” look like this person referenced a different section or message stick. If you have the corresponding files “2582 u[nd] 2233/36” they might give you a hint on what the author tried to reference. And he had a terrible handwriting, that’s for sure."    Piers replied: "Thanks Anneke,   This is really useful. I had incorrectly guessed that "cm lang" was "sammlung"!    The crossreferences to other artefacts aren't usually helpful. Often they are preceded by "dgl." which stands for dergleichen and the comparison is usually on the basis of visual similarities rather than origins.    My bad guess for the words preceding W.Australien was something like "dorf__ W. Australien". There are very few settlements in the north west of Western Australia, where I suspect the artefact comes from, but the word doesn't like any village I know from that area. (In fact, I lived in that region for three years.)    Thanks again for taking the time with this,  Piers"    Anneke replied: "“Dorf” could be possible but the first letter is a little too small to pass for a capital D. Plus, the capital W and A are not written in Sütterlin style. Therefore it seems likely the author would have written a modern D as well. Yet again, this is just a wild guess. Said letter could also be “v” followed by “o” and… something “h”-ish. Maybe “f” but “h” seems more likely because the lower… how do you call that? Anyway, the lower part of the letter is not strait but bent.    In writing that I just realized the next word is most certainly “sicher”. What I first thought was “u” looks more like “i” followed by “c”. That would make “…h sicher W[est] Australien”. Does that make any sense?    And a minor addition to the part on the right (it seems I’m having way too much fun deciphering this): if the first two lines are still written in Sütterlin, the first word on the second line could be “herrn”. That would make “Ge…- herrn Carl Sahl in Sidney”. Again, all the letters in Sahl and Sidney look much more modern than the rest, so the two words in the beginning could contain a mixture of old and new letters. Anyway, I doubt that whatever is written there contains a specific location.    I hope that helps. If you come across another illegible passage, feel free to ask me!

D.S. Davidson, who was not the original collector, wrote: "This collection was made over a period of years by an amateur who had the unusual interest to record what information he could get concerning each. Since the Australians are great traders it stands to reason that the locality given does not necessarily imply the place or origin altho this would probably be approximately true in most cases. The value of a great many specimens lies in the fact that they are from tribes which are now extinct" (p10). The date span for this collection is given as 1896-1931 (p.2)  25.3.24 NR: "LABEL ON OBJECT D4056"  11.04.24 PK: I examined this object in the Peabody on 11 April 2024 and noted that it is very light as if made from paperbark core.

The message stick is associated with Atherton, Cape York, Queensland according to the documentation.    Note that the responding message stick (WWT1926P424F3) is listed as originating in Atherton, Cairns District, Queensland. This strikes us as more likely since there is no Atherton in Cape York.     Atherton and Tully are in the Djirbal linguistic area and Cedar Creek is a long way away in the Turubul linguistic area northwest of Brisbane. Linguistic area is thus given as Djirbal.

It just says message stick. It looks like a cigar. Nora Pearce and June Simmons.’ Curatorial note: ‘Message stick, Australia. There was much discussion amongst anthropologists in the late nineteenth century about the use of message sticks in different parts of Australia. It was thought that they were widely used and would have served a range of functions such as signifiers of safe passage through new territories or as invitations. It has been suggested that the notches on the stick probably acted as reminders rather than as a language that could be read. Today they stand as an icon of Australian Aboriginal culture. This particular message stick was found with the donor's father and grandfather's papers after their deaths and little is known of its provenance or use.

They say the marks are only for ornament and that the "stick" is more of a token to accredit the messenger. This does not disprove the positive statements made eg by Mr Dawson that in some places the marks have a meaning. So far I cannot find an instance either in South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales or Victoria. Message sticks were not known to or used by the Kurnai. The messenger sometimes carried a boomerang, shield or spear as a token from the sender of the message.' It is therefore possible that these message sticks came from Howitt to Tylor. Letter 4: I must now explain the delay in procuring for you the humming instrument and the fire stick which you expressed a desire to obtain. I have now one tundun (Gippsland) one Bribbun (Queensland) and I expect shortly several others. [2] It is not however easy to procure these as the blackfellows dont like to give them up nor tell let white people see them. I have also a fire drilling apparatus from Queensland; I shall shortly have one belonging to the district and I am promised another from southern Queensland. I hope also to procure others. So soon as I obtain those or others, or find that the delay will be too long I shall send the collection off to you with further particulars.

This suggests a connection between some of the markings in rock art and some of the coded marks on message-sticks."  22.06.24 ID: "those are NOT just "arcs" but the sort of thing I call "nested arcs" which have the flat bit at the apex of the arc. These are classic "catenary entoptics" but I avoid calling them that. And I suspect that [KK] is not the best authority on where Caloola might have been. If these were about a ceremony at Cloncurry, then the Mitakoodi would certainly have been the initiators of the stick."

Madi noemt de krokodil "moeder" omdat zijn moeder uit de Balamumu clan van Gundo afkomstig was."    Translation (Annemarie Vervek): "Wooden letter stick, with in it cut-out diagonals, manufactured by Madi (Rose River, Dec. 1964). Made of ana-jal wood. According to the information the intersecting diagonals would involve the crocodile na-laragula), totem of the Balamumu group of Gundu, and is also important for the Rul-ritual of the Balamumu tribe. Madi calls the crocodile "mother" because his mother belonged to the clan Balamumu tribe of Gundo.    Original Dutch card file from RMV (RMV4090_35-IK_4090-35-1.JPG):  "Korte aanduiding: Houten breifstok, met erin uitgesneden diagonalen, vervaordigd door Madi (Rose River, dec. 1964)  Beschrijving:   Gemaakt van ana-jal hout. Volgens mijn informatie zouden de elkaar kru sende diagonalen betrekkring hebben op de krokodil (na-laragula), totem van de Balamumu groen van Gundu, en tevens belangrijk voor het Rul-ritueel van de Balamumu stam. De informatie is echter onbetrouwvaar, want een breifstokje met een der alijke versiering, die in Canberra is achterge-bleven (Oud no. 69) zou juist een Gunabibi breifstok zijn. In ieder geval noemt Madi de krokodil "moeder" omdat ziyn moeder uit de Balamumu clan van Gundu aftkomstig was.  Het briefstoje is alhier op het museum in de droogstoof geweest.

It uses symbolic references to carry the intent of the sender's communicaiton. Lettersticks were often of hand size and made of wood with incisions or burnt markings. This letterstick is earth pigments on incised wood.  This letterstick is one of four. It is a message to the Northern Teirrotory parliament from the Yolŋu nations and more broadly the peoples of Northern Arnhem Land.  On the right hand side of the letterstick the symbos for ŋärra'-parliament and the two Yolŋu pillars of society, Dhuwa and Yirritja, combine to speak of the Yolŋu parliments. this is then juxtaposed with another symbol of ŋärra'-parliament and etchings of six states and two territories of the Australian nation. These symbols combine to speak of the parliaments of Australian jurisdiction.  The subsequent message is one of the Yolŋu nations outlining the equal standing of their Ŋärra' institution compared to Australian parliaments. It is therefore together a declaration of ongoing Yolŋu sovereignty while also being a diplomatic gesture of intent, and also invitation, to work toward a place of mutual acceptance between Yolŋu and Australian jurisdictions.

I look to this appointment with hope that there may be more robust advocacy for First Nations people and strong commitment to reconciliation and a pathway for treaties.  In 2018 I was honoured to meet with the King on Yolngu country and handed him a letter stick which I have here in this parliament. It said: We declare that we have not been conquered. We declare that to this day we are sovereign people. We declare that we are subject to our Madayin system of law constituted by the unseen creator the universe and revealed to the givers of law, djangawu and barama. We continue to steward this system through our lawful authorities and government.  A Madayin system of law establishes magayamirr peace, order and good government is dhapirrk consistent in its statues, and is assented to by all Yolngu citizens through the wana lupthun ceremony.  On our Madayin system of law is guided by the Yolngu yothu yindi separation of powers. Our Madayin system of law is rule of law, not a rule of man. Our Madayin system of law is equal to any other system of law, provided with this was an explanation of the letter stick which read, ‘A letter stick is traditionally used to deliver a message by intermediaries across long distances. It uses symbolic references to carry the intent of the leaders and senders communication.’ Letter sticks were often of hand size and made of wood and incisions or burnt marks. This letter stick is earth pigments of incised wood. The letter stick is one of four. It has a message to the parliament of Australia from the Yolngu nations, and more broadly, the people of north east Arnhem Land.  On the right hand side of the letter stick the symbols for ngarra parliament and the two Yolngu pillars of society, dhuwa and yirritja combined to speak of the Yolngu parliaments. This is then juxtaposed with another system of ngarra parliament and etchings of six states and two Territories of the Australian nation. These symbols combined to speak of the parliaments of Australia jurisdiction. The subsequent message is one of the Yolngu nations outlining the equal standing of our ngarra institution compared to Australian parliaments. It is a declaration of ongoing Yolngu sovereignty while also being a diplomatic gesture of intent and also invitation to work toward a place of mutual acceptance between Yolngu and Australian jurisdictions.  I gave this letter stick to the then Prince and asked if he would deliver it to the Prime Minister of Australia. I asked him, ‘On behalf of the people standing before you and the Yolngu nations that you intervene on our behalf and take the strong position to acknowledge our sovereignty and promote a pathway to treaty’. I do not know what happened to the letter stick, and I am uncertain whether it got to Canberra, but Prince Charles accepted it on that day, and now we must look to the future and work towards righting the wrongs of the past.  The grave violations caused by colonisation continue until today. But there is opportunity now to work towards genuine reconciliation. For the first time, there is government intention at all levels of government to create treaties with First Nations people, treaties that respect and do not extinguish our sovereign status. I am hopeful that, with hard work, this can be achieved.  From the first day of the British invasion of this country, First Nations people have never been afforded the dignity or the treaty-making process. We are the only nation in the Commonwealth to be treated with such disrespect. Many of our people have died and continue to die fighting for our people, our county and culture."    PK: In summary, the four lettersticks are:  -United Nations [YMG2017]  -King Charles [YMG2018_01]  -YMG's office [YMG2018_02]  -NT Parliament [YMG2018_03]         	Piers Kelly	20180409-New_Matilda-Letterstick.jpg;20180409-New_Matilda-Yolngu.pdf;20180410-SMH-Prince_Charles.pdf;YMG2018_declaration_AM_20220804.jpg;YMG2018_explanation_AM_20220804.jpg

Thomson noted it was the 'second bark drawing' done on 14th July 1935, the other being a bark painting by Wuluwirr's father, the famous Djapu leader Wonggu Mununggurr. These were the first paintings collected by Thomson in Arnhem Land. This work is very unusual being a painted onto a piece of wood rather than a sheet of bark. It is similar in size and form to a 'letter stick' or message stick, the surface of which is usually incised rather than painted. Wuluwirr produced two further work on bark for Thomson, and all these are the only known paintings by this man who died before WW2."

The stick is 11.5 cm long x 1.8 cm wide.    It has some damage on one side.  I have always wondered what the carvings meant.    My mother spoke with deep affection of her time in Tennant Creek at 103 Australian General Hospital (AGH) in 1942 during WW11.    Apart from soldiers I gather there were many Aboriginal patients including children.     I am hoping to gain a clearer picture this year - I gather many people were moved to Katherine and Tennant Creek after the bombing of Darwin.    Happily she met my father in Tennant Creek at that time also!    Thank you for your research and website.    regards Janie    Follow up email 18 July 2018:  Hello Piers    my mum was (Captain) Sister Marie Eade (married name Sindel)  WW11 Service number NX70941     My mother told us that after the bombing of Darwin many troupes were brought back from the Middle East and sent to the north of Australia (she was in the Middle East as a specialist orthopedic nurse)    I can give more details about the hospital in the coming months - her main conversations were about Aboriginal patients etc....I will talk to my brother who may remember additional information.

They made a message stick to show us how people were invited to these events and we filmed them talking about the stick and its significance. One thing I could never really get anyone to explain however, is the meanings of the individual marks on the sticks and the repertoire of such marks and their meanings.

 	Description of Woiwurrung message stick communication 	text_reference	From Brough Smythe, R. 1878. The Aborigines of Victoria: With notes relating to the habits of natives of other parts of Australia and Tasmania. Vol. I. Melbourne & London: John Ferres. p133:     "When a [unspecified Victorian] tribe is encamped, it is not permitted to any other tribe to approach the camp without warning. Bent on revenge, or with an intent to murder, or for the purpose of stealing a young woman, a warrior will sometimes invade a camp in the night and seek to effect his purpose, but such enterprizes are not of very common occurrence. Whether for friendly intercourse or for war, the tribe which seeks a meeting must give notice of its coming in due form. A messenger (We-ar-garr), whose duty it is to proceed to the camp and state the intentions of the visitors, or to invite them to come to the camp of his tribe, is formally appointed by the principal man of the tribe, assisted by the old men in council. The young men are not allowed, under any circumstances, to take part in such deliberations as may be preliminary to so important a matter as a visit to or the reception of another tribe. On very solemn occasions two ambassadors or messengers are appointed; ordinarily, only one. The messenger has to carry a token, by virtue of which he passes safely through the lands of the several tribes. The token is a piece of wood, eight or ten inches in length, sometimes round and sometimes flat, and seldom more than one inch in thickness. On it are inscribed hieroglyphics which can be read and interpreted, and which notify all persons of the nature of the mission. If the mission is a friendly one, the stick is streaked mostly with red-ochre (Werrup); but if unfriendly, or for the purpose of demanding satisfaction for injuries done, or for war, then it is mostly streaked with white-ochre (Ngarrimbul). The principal man, in putting this stick into the hands of the messenger, and having named the tribe for which the invitation is intended, says, “You hold this now” (Koong-ak kinee Mirrambinerr). “Look out and find plenty of blackfellows” (Yane-wat benjer oonee kolen). “You tell all blackfellows to come here” (Toombooni boole-anin kolen-yan-an niool or Tom-buk U-mar-ko Koolin Ner-lin-go)." 	 	1878	terminus ante quem	 	Positive text reference	 	 	 	Chirila: Woiwurrung  Austlang: S36: Woiwurrung  Glottolog: woiw1237	 	 	On 30 August 2018, Barry Blake wrote to Piers Kelly: "The language is the language of the Melbourne area, which I was calling Woiwurrung. I hesitate only because I think Boonwurrung was pretty much the same.  These words come from William Thomas, who was stationed in the Dandenong area for some time, on the Woiwurrung-Boonwurrung border.    Wirrap and ngarrimbal are confirmed, and I can translate most of the sentences. I'm pretty rusty. If it is important, I could look harder at the sentences.

 	Reference to use of message sticks in the Herbert River area, from Carl Lumholtz	 	Lumholtz, Carl. 1892. Unter Menschenfressern : eine Vierjahrige reise in Australien. Hamburg: Artien-Gesellschaft.: "Die Stöcke sind ca. 10–15cm lang und 2–3 cm breit; einige sind flach, andere rund und oft mit verschiedenen Farben bemalt. Ich habe selbst bei Herbert River einen solchen Botenstrock gesehen, und der Schwarze Empfänger sagte mir, er verstände alles, was darauf stände, ging hin einen ähnlichen Stock zu fabriziren und rizte die Antwort hinein: gerade und trumme Linien, unregelmäßig und ungeordnent, wie die erhaltenen"     Lumholtz, Carl. 1889. Among cannibals: an account of four years' travels in Australia and of camp life with the aborigines of Queensland. New York: C. Scribner's Co.: "I myself saw one of these sticks which came to a native among my acquaintances on Herbert river. The man told me that he understood the inscription perfectly well, and he even prepared a similar stick, on which he wrote an answer."	 	 	 	 	Positive text reference	 	 	 	 	 	 	Lumholtz mentions message sticks in connection with the Herbert River. He stayed in the vicinity of Cardwell area for his fieldwork, which would suggest that Dyirbal is the best estimation for the linguistic area. 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	https://www.archive.org/stream/bub_gb_oJgLAQAAIAAJ?ref=ol#page/n9	https://archive.org/stream/amongcannibalsac1889lumh#page/302	 	 	 	Piers Kelly	00-Text_reference.png

 	A message stick in a private collection, first acquired by the explorer Lawrence Allen Wells in Western Australia or South Australia	unlocalisable	 	 	 	 	 	Message stick in a private collection	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Richard Davies	 	 	 	 	Richard Davies	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Richard Davies to Piers Kelly 28 November 2017:  "Lawrence Allen Wells was my great grandfather.    http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/wells-lawrence-allen-9043    I have shown pictures to University researchers in WA and they think that the stick came from the Mullewa/Geralton area, but it is guesswork. The stick may have come from from any of the WA areas he explored, and dates.... who knows.  I found the stick amongst my father's effects while he was very ill and close to death. I asked him about it but he couldn't even remember that he had it. I have bull roarers and boomerangs that Wells left to my dad. He had been given them by various Aboriginal people- probably in WA, though he did explore in SA until he was 73.    My wife and I have lived and worked with Aboriginal people for over 40 years in the NT. When I showed the stick to some of the Tennant Creek men they did not respond much. They would have told me had they any knowledge of such an object. We likewise have been given a plethora of artefacts from the Tennant Creek/Barkly Tableland region.    I have tried looking on the WWW for images of similar things but only found much cruder message sticks and so that is why I contacted you.    Thank you for responding to my email.    best wishes"    Piers Kelly replied: "Hi Richard,  How very interesting. I would say your great grandfather's message stick is plausibly from WA. It looks like others that I've seen from Western Australia at the Ethnologisches Museum in Berlin and at the National Museum of Australia. In a quick search of the database I've found this polished sandalwood style as far north Roebourne and as far south as Rottnest Island.     You will notice that this one (on the far right) from the British Museum is very similar and it's from the Murchison district: http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=505450&partId=1&searchText=message+stick&images=true&page=1    I can give you access to the message sticks database-in-progress if you like, but it still needs a lot of tidying up. Just let me know and I'll generate log-in details.    Would it be possible for me to include your artefact in the database too? It's certainly a fine piece of work, and other experts might have more to say about it than me.     All the best,    Piers  P.S. Do you remember which university researchers you contacted in WA? I would be keen to know if anybody else is working in the area of message sticks. "	Piers Kelly	2017-Davies_04a.jpg;2017-Davies_03.jpg;2017-Davies_01.jpg

CE2010P37	An annotated rubbing of a Daly River message stick, made by Hermann Klaatsch in 1904  	interpreted_artefact  glossed_artefact  localized_artefact  arnhem_land  calendar	Corinne Erckenbrecht's description: "Klaatsch hat die Muster von Sakralobjekten (Tjurunga und Schwirrhölzer) sowie von Botenstäben abgezeichnet, abgepaust, oder er hat mit weichem Pflanzenfaserstoff Abdrucke von ihnen gemacht. Zum Teil sind die Zeichnungen der Tjurunga und Schwirrhölzer auch mit Nummern versehen, deren Zuordnung jedoch unklar bleibt. Sie können weder mit den Original-Objekt- nummern von Hermann Klaatsch, die teilweise noch auf den von ihm gesammelten Objekten erhalten sind, noch mit den Objekt- nummern in der Klaatschsammlung des Rautenstrauch-Joest- Museums in Übereinstimmung gebracht werden. Es liegen Zeichnungen oder Pausen von elf Tjurunga bzw. Schwirrhölzern mit Nummern sowie Zeichnungen oder Pausen von fünf Tjurunga bzw.  Schwirrhölzern ohne Nummern vor (zum Teilin zwei Hälften sowie Vorder- und Rückseite gesondert gezeichnet).  Neben den Tjurunga- und Schwirrholzmustern gibt es auch zwei sehr ausdifferenzierte Muster von länglichen Objekten, die wegen der vielfältigen enthaltenen Informationen aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach Botenstäbe darstellen. Eine angedeutete Schnur, befestigt an einem Ende des länglichen Stabes, weist jedoch auch auf eine Nutzung als Schwirrholz hin. Während eines der Botenstabmuster lediglich geometrische Längs- und Querschnitte aufweist, ist das andere mit geometrischen Schnitten und einer figürlichen Darstellung versehen. Ausführliche Erläuterungen am Rand der Zeichnung erklären die Striche oder Schnitte auf dem Holz als kalendarische Angaben (Tage, Monate, Mond) und verweisen außerdem auf drei Stämme, die gemeinsam einen Corroboree abhalten. Die figürliche Darstellung ist „The strange king" betitelt.  Wie weitere Notizen auf diesen (zweiteiligen) Blättern belegen, wurde dieser Botenstab in Daly River (im westlichen Arnhem Land, Nordterritorium) von einem Mitglied des ,,Mullock Mullock Tribe” angefertigt. Dem anderen Botenstabmuster sind zwar auch ergänzenden Erläuterungen hinzugefügt, es existiert aber keine Herkunftsangabe.  Wie mehrfache Erwähnungen von Botenstäben in den Briefen an Schoetensack belegen, war Klaatsch an dem Phänomen dieser einfachen Nachrichtenübermittlung sehr interessiert. [fn:61: So z.B. in Brief Nr.14 und Brief Nr. 33 von Klaatsch an Schoetensack, PHK] Auch zeichnete er die Anordnung der Einritzungen in einem Brief an seinen Heidelberger Freund auf. Allerdings zeigte er sich enttäuscht von der profanen Bedeutung der Zeichen: Die diagonalen Striche in die eine Richtung bedeuteten nichts anderes als ,,Unser ,tribe’ kommt in dieser Richtung” und diagonale Striche in die gegenläfige Richtung ,,Euer ,tribe’ soll aus der anderen Richtung kommen”; die aus diesen aufeinander zulaufendedn diagonalen Strichen zusammengesetzen Winkel bedeuteten: ,,Dann wollen wir uns treffen und zusammen Corroboree abhalten”. Klaatschs ernuuchterter Kommentar dazu lautet: ,,Ich hatte mehr complicirte Dinge erwartet und erhofft, werde meine Studien fortsetzen”[fn:62: Brief Nr. 14, S.25, von Klaatsch an Schoetensack vom 5.-15 Oktober 1904, Telegraphenstation Floraville bei Burketown, PHK]" p38    In Erckenbrecht, Corinna. 2010. Auf der Suche den Ursprüngen: Die Australienreise des Anthropologen und Sammlers Hermann Klaatsch 1904-1907. Cologne: Gesellschaft für Völkerkunde, Verein zur Förderung des Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museums der Stadt Köln.    JB Translation: "Klaatsch copied or traced the patterns of sacred objects (tjurunga and bullroarers) as well as the patterns of message sticks, or he made impressions of them with soft vegetable fiber. Partly the drawings of tjurunga and bullroarers are also accompanied with numbers, their assignment remains unclear. They can be matched neither with the original object numbers of Hermann Klaatsch, some of which are still preserved on the objects he has collected, nor with the object numbers in the Klaatsch collection of the Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum. There are drawings or traced sketches of eleven tjurunga or bullroarers with numbers, as well as drawings or traced sketches of five tjurunga and bullroarers without numbers (drawn separately to split two halves as well as front and back).  In addition to the tjurunga and bullroarers, there are also two very differentiated patterns of elongated objects. They most probably depict message sticks because they contain diverse information. However, an implied string attached to one end of the elongated stick, also indicates it being used as a bullroarer. While one of the message stick’s patterns has only geometric longitudinal and cross sections, the other one has geometric sections and a figurative depiction.  Detailed explanations at the edge of the drawing claim the lines or cuts on the wood to be calendar data (days, months, moon), and also refer to three tribes that hold a corroboree together. The figurative depiction is titled "The strange king”. According to the further notes on these (two-part) pages, this message stick was made in Daly River (in western Arnhem Land, Northern Territory) by a member of the "Mullock Mullock Tribe". Although the patterns on the other message stick were also accompanied with explanations, there is no indication of origin.  According to several references to message sticks in the letters to Schoetensac, Klaatsch was very interested in the phenomenon of this simple communication. [fn:61: So z.B. in Brief Nr.14 und Brief Nr. 33 von Klaatsch an Schoetensack, PHK] He also sketched the arrangement of the carvings in a letter to his friend Heidelberg.  However, he was disappointed by the mundane meaning of the signs: the diagonal strokes in one direction mean nothing other than “our tribe comes in that direction”, and diagonal strokes in the opposite direction mean “your tribe should come from another direction”; the angles composed of these diagonal lines mean: "Then we want to meet and hold Corroboree together." Klaatsch's commentary is: "I had expected more complicated things and hoped I to continue my studies”.    Corinna Erckenbrecht message to PK (4 Feb 2019): "The description of the message stick reads from top to bottom:    „Mond = Moon (= looking like a spiderweb)    Monat = Month (= 5 horizontal lines)    Zigzag (= can’t read that myself at the moment)    The strange King (= human figure)    3 tribes meeting corrobori (= 3 triangular shapes with lines)      Tag = day = 18 horizontal lines    Mullock Mullock Tribe = semicircular line with 3 horizontal lines in it    by itself“     	a member of the "Mullock Mullock Tribe"	1904	terminus ante quem	 	Image of a message stick (artefact missing)	traditional	NT	TopEnd	Chirila: Malak Malak  Austlang: N22: Malak Malak  Glottolog: mull1237	 	 	The origin of the message stick is Daly River, western Arnhem Land, Northern Territory  "Mullock Mullock" tribe in Klaatsch's notes	 	Transcription of Klaatsch annotations, provided by Corinna Erckenbrecht (pers. comm, 4 February 2019):    Mond = Moon (= looking like a spiderweb)    Monat = Month (= 5 horizontal lines)    Zigzag (= CE: [illegible])    The strange King (= human figure)    3 tribes meeting corrobori (= 3 triangular shapes with lines)      Tag = day = 18 horizontal lines    Mullock Mullock Tribe = semicircular line with 3 horizontal lines in it    by itself“	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Erckenbrecht, Corinna. 2010.

Message sticks from Arnhem Land have vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines, diamond patterns and so on; with human figures; like those from western Arnhem Land, most refer specifically to economic transactions, and are accompanied by verbal messages. Ceremonial message sticks, in contrast, are distinctively shaped, bearing sacred designs, or take the form of raugga emblems, sometimes hung with feathered pendants, and sometimes made of ward beeswax. Mostly they refer to approaching rituals, or to ceremonial trade relations. The item is not mentioned in the Ooldea Report."    "bumerau, message stick.

In some regions namely Queensland and S.E. Australia and southern edge of the Nullabor, and Melville and Bathurst Islands designs sometimes refer to topographical features which the messenger must pass before his destination is reached. Sometimes also there were notches representing the length of the journey in days. N.E. Arnhem Land sticks (like these) do not have such topographical features represented however. Message sticks from Arnhem Land are usually small flat slabs of wood, or a cylinder tapering at both ends. Patterns are mainly vertical diagonal lines, diamonds, and human figures. NB: A variety of such sticks are shown in Ref. 1. to 5. The designs on ceremonial message sticks have mythological significance. They refer to approaching rituals or ceremonial trade relations. N.B. Those on Bathurst and Melville Islands are more elaborately carved and usually constitute an invitaiton to a ceremony (e.g. mortuary rite) or are informative e.g. notification of an event such as a death. According to both Howitt and Roth who collected in 1897 and 1904 respectively, message sticks were used for several purposes, to call participants of a ceremony together, to invite fellow tribesman to a hunt or fight, and to convey a personal request from one aboriginal through a messenger to another asking him for food or goods, or to inform of a dead (the latter two being more secular usages.)   ...

A man came from Ilimar to the mainland as a messenger holding a 'gadgad' or message stick. He showed it to Gawidji, a lizard, inviting him and his friends to a ceremony. (rt.) All the gawidji men in human form went over to South Goulburn Island - 'Wiela', for the ceremony in their canoes (centre). As they stepped out on the island they changed back to animal forms (left bottom) [PK: should be 'right bottom']. The more central two lizards with black spots are 'gawidji'. The third lizard more to the right is a slightly different type of lizard called 'Marwagala' and to the extreme right is the goose 'Manimunag'. During the ceremony a fight developed between the 'gawidji' and 'marwagala' lizard and the 'gawidji' is knocked down (top right level). He dies and is put on a burial platform (to left of this level)."  ...  "Natural earth pigment on bark.  Red-pink ochre background on brown bark.

He gathered some shellfish while visiting the Anbarra community at Lalarr-gadjirripa soon after the roving Kunapipi camp, containing several 'business' men, arrived from Maningrida and settled on the 'old' Lalarr-gadjirripa north–south dune. Most of Balanganba's haul went to this camp, which was prohibited to all females and uninitiated males." p. 127     PK wrote to Betty Meehan on 23 September 2020. Meehan replied on the following day, but gave a fuller account on 27 September 2020. Here is the main text of it: " I have had time to look at the field notes that Rhys and I kept whilst living with the An-barra on the banks of An-gacha Wana (Blyth River) in 1973. I will summarise (and quote where appropriate) what I found.  On that day several people who were camped on the eastern bank of An-gacha Wana, probably at a home base called Inanganduwa, had arrived at Lalarr Gu-jirripa to bring some items of material culture that they had made for sale. These were to go, eventually, to the Maningrida organisation that managed the sale of such items. Eventually the various makers would be paid for these items by the person managing this business in Maningrida (probably Dan Gillespie at that time). Both Rhys and I processed these items best we could in our conditions before they were collected and taken to Maningrida. In my field notes I mention: bark paintings, hand woven bags, shell necklaces and, significantly, some items from Darkie Balanganba and Susan Anadjilwa a description of which I will quote in full below. At the time Darkie and Susan were living in another community on the eastern bank of An-gacha Wana, possibly Inanganduwa.  This information comes from one of my field note books - An-barra Project, Book 13, 18/3/73- 13/4/73, page 76:  "Darkie Balanganba and Susan Anadjilwa both sent wooden digging sticks with Jackie B. They had grooves on both ends of one side. Those on one side denoted how much of their pension they should/would give towards Jackie B’s and Jackie Dj’s boat. Those on the other end indicated how much they wanted to spend on food. The wood on these sticks is called malwan, and the stick itself is called mark/mak.”  I also looked at Rhys’ field notes for the same day.

Although relatively close 'as the crow flies' to each of these townships, large bodies of intervening water (rivers, straits, swamps) make direct access impossible. The only means of entering Jimarda are by way of a 120 km dry season track from Maningrida, an arduous sea voyage from either Maningrida or Milingimbi, or by light aircraft."

Mann river is more certainly within the Gunwinggu area, and the Cadell river in the Burarra area. What are the outstations on the Mann River that are Gunwinggu?    Murray Garde (2014, 104-105) wrote: "Using a ‘big placename’ to refer to an outstation can in some contexts create confusion when such big names have also become designations for other focal sites in the ‘estate’. An example of this involves the kun-bolkngeykimuk or ‘big placename’ of Kubumi, which was used to refer to an outstation on the Mann River established in the early 1980s by people of the Kulmarru clan. The kun-bolkngeyyahwurd or ‘small placename’ for the location of the outstation is Yikarrakkal. The focal place for Kubumi is a stretch of the Mann River where the river widens and white sandy banks are a popular camping place for people from the outstation, which is located only a kilometre upstream to the south. In the period of 1990 to 1997 when I lived at Yikarrakkal, movement between the outstation and the river camp was constant. With both the outstation and the river camp both being referred to by the name Kubumi, it became very difficult to disambiguate reference to these two places when speaking to people who did not live at Yikarrakkal. In 1990 the community decided to deal with this confusion by using the kun-bolkngeyyahwurd of Yikarrakkal for the outstation and the kun-bolkngeykimuk Kubumi, for the river camp. Kuninjku people in the Mann River region will refer to the outstation as either Yikarrakkal or Kubumi depending on their assessment of shared knowledge with interlocutors. ‘Big names’ are more widely known outside of the local sphere of interaction."  This is from Garde, Murray. 2014. "Doing things with toponyms: The pragmatics of placenames in Western Arnhem Land." In Indigenous and minority placenames: Australian and international perspectives, edited by Ian D Clark, Luise Hercus and Laura Kostanski, 97-121.    On this basis, my best guess for the Mann river outstation is Yikarrakkal (also, and formerly known as Kubumi). This is Linguistic area 1.   For Linguistic area 2, I have assigned Gunibidji (Ndjebbana) on the basis that this is the traditional language of Maningrida	 	no message can be determined so far	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Museum and Art Gallery of the Northern Territory	 	Peter Cooke	 	 	 	12°30'13.6"S 	134°06'41.5"E	Absolute coordinates for Yikarrakkal outstation	 	 	 	 	 	PK to ask Peter Cooke if he was the messenger, and if the sender gave him a verbal message that he had forgotten or whether Cooke was asked to pass on the message	Piers Kelly	MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_01.JPG;MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_02.JPG;MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_03.JPG;MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_04.JPG;MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_05_cat.JPG;MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_06_cat.JPG

Meehan replied on the following day, but gave a fuller account on 27 September 2020. Here is the main text of it: " I have had time to look at the field notes that Rhys and I kept whilst living with the An-barra on the banks of An-gacha Wana (Blyth River) in 1973. I will summarise (and quote where appropriate) what I found.  On that day several people who were camped on the eastern bank of An-gacha Wana, probably at a home base called Inanganduwa, had arrived at Lalarr Gu-jirripa to bring some items of material culture that they had made for sale. These were to go, eventually, to the Maningrida organisation that managed the sale of such items. Eventually the various makers would be paid for these items by the person managing this business in Maningrida (probably Dan Gillespie at that time). Both Rhys and I processed these items best we could in our conditions before they were collected and taken to Maningrida. In my field notes I mention: bark paintings, hand woven bags, shell necklaces and, significantly, some items from Darkie Balanganba and Susan Anadjilwa a description of which I will quote in full below. At the time Darkie and Susan were living in another community on the eastern bank of An-gacha Wana, possibly Inanganduwa.  This information comes from one of my field note books - An-barra Project, Book 13, 18/3/73- 13/4/73, page 76:  "Darkie Balanganba and Susan Anadjilwa both sent wooden digging sticks with Jackie B. They had grooves on both ends of one side. Those on one side denoted how much of their pension they should/would give towards Jackie B’s and Jackie Dj’s boat. Those on the other end indicated how much they wanted to spend on food. The wood on these sticks is called malwan, and the stick itself is called mark/mak.”  I also looked at Rhys’ field notes for the same day. He says: "Jackie B; Peter Dj and Jackie M came up with craft from the other side including a shell necklace, + 2 string ‘halters’ worn by young girls. Betty took notes. also some lovely small dilly bags + some bark paintings (the latter by Jackie K...” (Rhys Jones: Book 18, 31/3/73 - 12/4/73)  It is probable that Rhys and I bought the so-called ‘digging sticks’ from Darkie and Susan and that they are the items that are now in the MAGNT.

WBS1914P133F36	Photograph of pre-initiates at Gunbalanya (Oenpelli) carrying ceremonial wands	localized_artefact  arnhem_land  pigmentation	This image appears in various publications of Baldwin Spencer including:    Spencer, Baldwin. 1913. "Preliminary Report: On the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory."  Bulletin of the Northern Territory 7:7-28. The caption is "Figure 3 — Boys carrying wands when sent out to summon members of distant tribes."     Later it appears in:    Spencer, Baldwin. 1914. Native tribes of the Northern Territory of Australia. London: Macmillan & Co. (The relevant description is on pages 35- 36).   The caption here is:  "Fig. 36.—Boys carrying the Wands called Uro-Ammi, when summoning Members of Distant Camps to the Initiation Ceremony. Kakadu tribe"    Better contextualising information is given in Spencer, Baldwin. 1928. Wanderings in wild Australia. 2 vols. Vol. 2. London: Macmillan.     "Two Mengerrdji youths singing at the Gaagudju camp at Oenpelli during their travels prior to initiation ceremonies. East Alligagor River, 2 July 1912.  July 2nd  Late yesterday evening we were sitting in our mosquito-proof tent … when we heard a special singing, coming from the direction of the native camp. It was repeated again in the morning, when we found that the singing came from two youths who were standing close together facing one another, each of them leaning on a wand, coloured red and white. The song they sang was:  ‘Kadimanga,  Da laian a.  Da laian a.  Kadimanga,  Da laian a,  Da laian a.’  It was repeated time after time, and always the women, sitting in camp, replied with the refrain, ‘Wait Ba! Wait Ba!’’ repeated as often as they could without drawing breath. They sometimes do this fourteen or fifteen times. I often heard it thirteen, and naturally it dies away towards the close when their breath is exhausted. It is sung on a high note; the Wait is short, the Ba emphasised and prolonged. For days after the boys have come to the men’s camp they stand up every now and then and chant their song and, time after time, from camps, some so far away that you can only just hear the sound, comes back the refrain ‘Wait Ba! Wait Ba!’ it is one of the most picturesque of their songs, especially when heard in the bush at night time."[fn:21:Spencer, Wanderings in wild Australia pp.765-6]    The above information is reproduced in the 2008 Batty, Allen Morton volume, who include some editorial observations:    [Eds wrote]: Every Gaagudju man has to go through five initiation ceremonial stages during his lifetime. The first ceremony marks the point where a youth leaves the company of women and children and is accepted as a man, the final when he is an old man.  The two Mengerrdji youths photgraphed here were visiting the Gaagudju camp at Oenpelli during a tour prior to their beginning the second stage of initiation. The wands they carry were instruments of safe passage from one part of the country to another, made by themselves under the supervision of the elders. p151    The image also appears in Mulvaney, John, ed. 1982.

The 'wands' referred to by Spencer may or may not be distinct from a message stick. When Spencer describes the youths leaning on their wands, this is not what is happening in the photograph, where one man is leaning on a spear. Compare the wand in AMSD: SLSA_PRG280_1_11_60.

Sadly the NLA copy is missing all accompanying images [the originals are problem at Museums Victoria] but it does include this caption:     Figure 4.—Aboriginal carrying message or “Paper yabber.” n.p.    Note that Spencer reserved the term "paper yabber" for a pen-and-paper letter and it looks like he has amended the caption from "yabber" to "wand" (For Spencer a paper wand is not so much a message stick as a ceremonial object that confers passport like protection status).

NML56_24_497	A message stick from Queensland held in the National Museums Liverpool	interpreted_artefact  glossed_artefact  provenance_discovery	Pers. comm. M. S-F: "The stick was collected by James Trackson around 1887. It includes a hand written message on paper in an Aboriginal dialect and was apparently translated in English by a gentleman named Mr W. Souter in 1887." (7 August 2020)    "If I remember correctly, the note which accompanied the stick was written on the back of an old newspaper advert or article. It is an invitation to a feast and I think there is map drawn in pencil to indicate the location of the feast. The stick and message were sent to Norwich Castle Museum with a letter from James Trackson in 1896. The original documents are all kept in our archives and I would be happy to send you copies of these." (13 August 2020)	 	1887	terminus ante quem	 	Message stick in a collection	traditional	QLD	 	 	 	 	The origin of the message stick is given simply as “Norman River”. It therefore cannot be associated with a linguistic area.    Norman River flows through the Ngawun and Mbara linguistic areas. (Note that in the original Chirila coordinates, the Ngawun centroid should be shifted to the east so that it occupies the Ngawun polygon and the Mayi-Kulan centroid point needs to be shifted north so that it occupies the Mayi-Kulan polygon.) Ascertaining the traditional owners may involve knowing where James Trackson was on the Norman River. Nothing immediately comes up in Trove. 	 	Circumstantially it appears that the interpretation that accompanies this object was invented by W. Souter:  "Blackfellow down the river having a feast (corroberie) plenty of fish and big bullock sing song, tribe of blacks from the Norman river are down on the flat waiting to have a big fight when plenty of hair will be obtained - a big Bush fire to the setting sun from the camp (evidently westward) “Koombamba” (evidently name of tribe) set fire to the Bush which is spread over a large tract of country and will drive game towards the camp - a large lagoon (stretch of water) is to the east of the camp containing plenty of fish but no “Bunyip” (a water demon) “Koongarra” plenty and very fat (this possibly represents cattle) attend the feast all who can and bring “Kaambra” with you (weapons)."

MIRAGE1974	A message stick sent from Midui on Maragulidban Creek into Maningrida	interpreted_artefact	Our special correspondent up the creek. 1974. “Mechanical humbug strikes again!!” Maningrida Mirage 3 (31):2-3.  Mechanical humbug strikes again!!   Boat motors gave some people up the Liverpool River last week-end “big mobs of humbug”.  The first victim was John Hunter. John was on his way to visit the people at Maragulidban, taking an icebox to help them start a fishing business. He went up Maraguildban Creek first and picked up young Ivan Louie, one of the Peter Maryewongas sons at the top landing. Then they set out for Midui, the landing on the Liverpool River where the fishing boat was waiting.  A few hundred yards from the mouth of the creek the propeller stopped turning. John check out the shear pin and as that was ok, decided a broken drive shaft was to blame. John and Ivan Louie spent [2] Saturday night battling the mosquitoes and sandflies on a mud flat behind the mangroves. They expected the Gunwinggu boat Midui to come looking for them on Sunday but it didn’t show up. About 2pm the Pinders and Peter Cooke arrived on the scene in a 10ft boat. They took Ivan Louie back to the Maraguilidban Creek landing and were heading back to pick up John when their motor gave up the ghost.  John was waiting expectantly on the bank when they paddled into view about 6pm.  With a full moon to light the way and the guide with them they set out for Maningrida, 17 miles distant. They were nearing the junction of the Liverpool and Thompinson Rivers when a search party in the Crocodilus boat took the little boat in tow.   On Monday, Micky Nalaulman arrived back from a fishing trip with an icebox full of Maragulidban Creek barra and a message stick from the captain of the Midui, Curly Bagalubu. The Midui didn’t show up, the message stick explained, due to a broken throttle cable – more mechanical humbug!!  – by our special correspondent up the creek. p2  	 	 	 	 	Positive text reference	traditional	NT	TopEnd_arnhem_east	Chirila: Gunwinggu  Austlang: N65: Kunwinjku   Glottolog: guma1252  	Chirila: Gunibidji  Austlang: N74: Ndjebbana  Glottolog: djee1236  	 	 	 	"On Monday, Micky Nalaulman arrived back from a fishing trip with an icebox full of Maragulidban Creek barra and a message stick from the captain of the Midui, Curly Bagalubu.

He's sent a message to this mob. He says 'We want you mob.' And they said back to them 'Ok!' 'We're coming!' is what they said. 'Send us a smoke signal.' They'd light a fire. They'd see it. 'Oh yeah, there they are'. They'd travel ... Through Arnhem Land they used to travel. They arrived – this group. And this group. They met them first, ahead of the others.

Nipper eagerly volunteered to decipher it. Oomagun smiled broadly; he was now to have his turn in the headlines.  The markings on this stick told that Whisky (I use their [181] white-feller names where they have one, as the aboriginal name may be confusing) advised the conspirators to leave the man alone. But Donkey (a powerful man) insisted that Worachi was very strong and he was going to kill him. (The killer believes that he absorbs some of the strength and cunning of the slain man, should he eat portions of his kidney fat.) Jack, for the same reason that moved Donkey, also wished to kill Worachi. But George prevented him at the critical moment. Three men, Moby, Wornerun and Ardgat warned the now hunted W orachi that the killers were close on his heels, and ad- vised him to hide in Parrywarri Creek. He did so. Eventually, reconciliation took place and Worachi re- turned to camp. Later, he was treacherously slain, just as told by Oombali and the witnesses. Grace's Knob, and the place where Worachi was killed, were marked on the stick.  The reverse side of the stick told that the slayers and their associates (Oomagun, Donkey, Marmadu, Dun- gat and Oombali) were now threatened by Worachi's tribal relations, who threatened to come from their camp at Turkey Creek (East Kimberley) and attack them. The marks of these coming avengers, the locality where Jack first attempted to kill Worachi, and other localities were also given. Yet another stick, an old message this, gave details of two previous killings by Oomagun of a man and a woman, in which killings Big Paddy, Duncan and Donkey were implicated. Unfortunately the animals were packed and the troops were moving off before I could jot down all the markings on this stick. It was a slow job, to draw the stick on paper, get the certain interpretation of each mark,and jot it down mark after mark" 182    Transcript of 20210213-Invaluable-H3247-L242175187.jpg: "Tracker Bull Bul's message stick to me.

JH wrote to PK on 28 August 2021: "There is indeed a message stick connected with the first Christian funeral on Groote Eylandt or, more specifically, a memorial service for Dakalarra some weeks after the funeral as he had naturally been buried quickly.

I am glad my friend Laura put you in touch with me but she has slightly mis-remembered our conversation.   The truth, however, is even better than that. There are actually TWO message sticks. There is indeed a message stick connected with the first Christian funeral on Groote Eylandt or, more specifically, a memorial service for Dakalarra some weeks after the funeral as he had naturally been buried quickly. This stick is NOT in the museum. I have it, or at least my brother does.   The message stick I deposited at the Museum was reputedly the last stick from the southwestern Gulf communities. It has a complex and fascinating life story. I attach my notes. (Laura, you will be very interested in this too).  This stick needs to be written up properly. I am gradually getting everything out of my head onto ‘paper’ but ……  Please stay in touch about this.  Kind Regards    John      John W Harris"    John Harris's attached notes (sent to PK on 28 August 2021): THE STORY OF THE MESSAGE STICK – John Harris’s notes    (This is the draft story so far.  More information will be provided in due course)    1) Sometime in 1949 or 1950, a message stick was carved at Ngukurr (then the Roper River Mission).  The stick was to advise Mara people at Borroloola about a ceremony 2 ½ months later at Bing Bong.  Yulki Nungumajbarr says she saw the stick when she was a small girl. Kevin Rogers says that he also saw the stick when his grandfather showed it to his father.  Remarkably,Kevin related this information to me BEFORE the message stick reappeared in August 2008, not having seen it for 60 years or known that it still existed. We published his recollections in our Ngukurr book We Are Aboriginal before the stick resurfaced. I think this stick is remembered because it was the ‘last stick’ and associated with a memorable and significant ceremony.    2) The ceremony was the final part of a funeral ceremony for an old man who had died at Limnen River. He was a Mara man .  He was Gordon Forrest’s father. (I am yet to find out his exact relationship to the other people in this story!)    3) The exact purpose of the stick was to advise people from Borroloola to meet some Ngukurr people at Bing Bong for the ceremony.  The messenger who carried the stick gave the stick to Simon at Borroloola. Simon was a Mara man. Simon did not use a surname.  Simon’s descendants use Simon as a surname.    4) Three canoes went from Ngukurr to Bing Bong.  The people in the canoes were related to Simon.  Yulki’s mother, Bessie, was sister to Queenie, Simon’s wife, (Bessie is very old but still living – died since I wrote that). Kevin Roger’s father, Roger, was also a brother-in-law of Simon.  Canoe 1: Reuben Nunggumajbarr.  Yulki was in this canoe.  Canoe 2: Calico (Henry Nunggumajbarr’s                    father)  Canoe 3: Roger.  (Kevin Roger’s father).    5) The 3 canoes went down the Roper River, then south down the gulf, sleeping for a day or two at different places – Roper Mouth, Limnen River, Rosie Creek, Central Island, Macarthur River. (Must find traditional names for all these places) (“We ate turtle and fish and lilies all the way.”)      6) They then went to Bing Bong where they met Simon and his people for the ceremonies which lasted for two weeks on the waxing moon until full moon.  The remains of the dead man from the previous year were wrapped in paper bark.  Yulki and Roger say this was the last paper-bark coffin they have seen (but this does not necessarily mean it was the last such burial in the region.)    7) After the ceremony was finished the three canoes went to Borroloola for a few days.  Then they returned to Ngukurr by the same route they had followed on the way down.    8)  About 1960, ten years after the ceremony, Simon gave the message stick to Max Field, in Borroloola.  As Max says, Simon gave it to him ‘because he was my mate and he thought I might like it.’  Max did not enquire much about the stick at the time, not being particularly interested ‘in that kind of thing’ as he said to me – he simply put it in a safe place.  Max remains a close friend of Simon’s family.    9) In August 2008, Max Field attended the Ngukurr Centenary.  He brought the stick with him and to show me and asked if I could interpret the stick.  I could partly interpret it (I have a similar stick given to my father.  My father had once had several sticks and explained about how to read them. Message sticks are not complicated. They are to authenticate the bearer and also to function as an aide memoir. Thy contain very basic essential information but bearer knows the full story.)      10)Max Field gave the stick to me for safe keeping and to ascertain its value as an artifact of interest to a museum, preferably an Australian museum.    11) This is my ‘reading’ of the stick.  One face of the stick (‘front’) says that a large number of people will travel by canoe.  The ‘top’ face is a calendar which says that the ceremony will take place following two full moons on the next rising (waxing) moon after that, up until the next full moon.  The face opposite the canoe  (‘back’) face  is authenticating marks – clan marks? – but the simpler marks on the underside (‘bottom’) may be decorative only.  The stick was both a passport and an aide-memoire, its full meaning known to the bearer. The timing of the ceremony is the most crucial information which the bearer may need to check precisely)    12) Those who saw the stick in 1949 say they have never seen one since.  They say it is the ‘last stick’.  Those people who saw the stick for the first time at Ngukurr in August 2008 were extremely interested. They all say they had never seen one before at all.     John Harris wrote on 30 August: "Dear Piers,  I am glad someone is interested in the stick. It is definitely at the NMA and I will find out how it has been accessioned.  The part of the story you don’t know is that Max Field, to whom Simon gave the stick in Borroloola, had terminal cancer when he showed me the stick at Ngukurr in 2009. He asked me if I could read it and was delighted I could because he basically knew its story and I confirmed it. But his reason for showing me was really otherwise. Eventually he got around to asking me if I thought it had any value. I agreed to find out.  I approached Michael Pickering who was head of Indigenous whatever at NMA at the time. He suggested Wally Caruana for an independent valuation. In due course, we agreed on a price, Wally waived his valuation fee and  I sold it to NMA on behalf of Max Field. The price was quite enough buy a good bed and to provide palliative care for Max Field before he passed away not long afterwards.  So this stick has a long and interesting journey and has only come to light because Max heard I would be at Ngukurr and drove up from Borroloola to find me. Otherwise it would, I suspect, have  simply disappeared, thrown out probably with other junk in his drawer where it had been for 50 years.  Below this email are some not-very-good photos. They are approximately the actual size of the stick.  I have some photos somewhere of most of the participants in the story of the stick. Possibly even Simon if I can find it.  Cheers  John"    John Harris forwarded the following email: "From: John Harris <jwharris@bible.org.au>  Subject: message stick  Date: 27 January 2009 at 5:51:34 pm AEDT  To: "wallycaruana@optusnet.com.au" <wallycaruana@optusnet.com.au>       Dear Wally,     I’m John Harris and your name was given to me by Michael Pickering at the national Museum.  I don’t know if we have met.  Probably not but I am well known in some circles for my writing on Aboriginal history etc.     I am holding a message stick from Eastern Arnhem Land.  It’s little, about 13 cm long and originally painted with ochre which is rubbing off a bit. I attach a couple of photos.  If it belonged to me I would donate it to the museum but it belongs to an old chap – a whitefella like me – who is very old, very sick and very broke.  So I guess I should try and get him something for it.  His name is Max Field and he is currently undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.     The quite amazing thing about this message stick is that I have been able to reconstruct its story.     An old Aboriginal man - Simon - gave it to Max in Borroloola about 1960 because ‘he was a mate and he thought he might like it’.  Max at the time was not interested much in its story or anything, accepted it as a gift but he asked no questions.     Last August I attended the centenary of the Ngukurr (Roper River) community.  I had helped them write a book and photographic record of their history.  In that book one of the Ngukurr elders, Kevin Joshua, wrote that he had only once ever seen a real message stick when he was a small boy ie 1950 or so.  His father had showed it to him and read it to him.  He said it was the last message stick he had ever seen.     Well this is turning into a long story but Max Field decided to attend the centenary celebrations in Ngukurr and drove from Borroloola.  Trying to work out what would happen to his effects, he thought of the message stick. He had heard I was going to be there at Ngukurr and thought that if anyone could read it maybe I could.   I had never actually met him before but he knew of me.  Anyway he showed me this stick and asked me what it meant.  I could partly read it.  Sticks of course never have the full story, not away from the bearer, functioning as an aide memoire and a kind of passport.  It referred to a ceremony that people would travel to by canoe and gave a calendar and clan markings.  As I was trying to read the stick, someone with a video camera asked me if they could video me and the stick.  Thus the event became a little public and people took notice.  An elderly woman, Yulki Nungumajbarr, overheard me and came up to us.       ‘I was on that canoe trip’, she said.  “My family went with a lot of other people to Borroloola for a ceremony when I was a little girl.  It took us a few weeks to get there, eating turtles and fish and water lilies.’     Well we worked out a lot more things but to cut a long story short, this message stick was sent from Ngukurr to Borroloola about 1950 to plan a ceremony.  It is the last message stick ever to have been seen by these people,  as they say none have been carved or used since.  It is actually the last real message stick of this region.  And remarkably it has come back to where it came from!     Wally, I have no idea of its value, indeed I did not consider whether or not it had a value, but Max is quite ill and he worries about his wife and asked me if maybe it was worth anything.     So there you have it.  I have no idea what it costs to have it valued or what its value is or whether it would even be worth as much as its valuation fee, but  I feel I should do something for Max.  I have a sneaking feeling that the stick with its story are important but I don’t know for sure.  The museum of course is interested.  I am contacting you at Michael Pickering’s suggestion so sorry to impose myself on you but can you advise me where to go from here?     Sincerely     John"    On 4 August 2022 AF of NMA wrote: "The message stick from Ngukurr is in our collection. It has a receipt number IR 5032.0001. It hasn’t been accessioned yet."

He told me that they used longer lines to enumerate grown men, and shorter ones for children, perhaps with another line next to a man signifying his wife.

From Austlang here is the Location Information for Marri Tjevin, which is not on CB's map:     Swamplands at mouth of Moyle River and coastal country near Cape Dombey (Tindale 1974).    Marri Tjevin and Marri Ammu are two closely related dialects whose country lies along the coast north of the mouth of the Moyle River, extending up towards the Dashwood Plains. Marri Tjevin occupies the southern part of this area, with Magati Ke and Marri Ngarr to the south. Marri Ammu then has Menthe and Merranunggu to its north and north-east respectively. Their sister dialect Marrithiyel lies to their east. There are a number of active outstations on Marri Tjevin and Marri Ammu country proper, with Marri Tjevin and Marri Ammu communities also resident at Wadeye (Green & Nordlinger viewd November 2020)."    Note that Marrithiyel is given as a synonym for Marri Ammu, and this is indicated on CB's map. Therefore I would place it south of CB's Mattithiyel but north of her her Magati Ke and Marringarr.

There is not a particularly strong tradition of message stick use in Central Australia, and if the wood does turn out to be Banksia dentata it would contradict this provenance since this species only grows in the tropics, according to the Atlas of Living Australia."    PK's assessment as of 15 September 2021: The UNEMA metadata indicates "Central Australia" but this is contradicted by the register of the Armidale Folk Museum which lists the place of origin for 1983.2.74  as "Western Qld, Boulia?" and the place of origin for 1983.2.75  as "Gulf of Carpentaria dist.[district]". My assessment is that "Central Australia" is wrong. There is no source for this information and it is likely an error that crept in when the objects were loaned to UNEMA. Message sticks are rare in Central Australia. Both objects also appear to have been made from the stem of a Banksia dentata, which does not grow in Central Australia.  I'm also sceptical of Western Qld, Boulia. The question mark in the register indicates that this is a guess, and in 1983 the most substantial descriptions of Australian message sticks were objects from Boulia (as described by Walter Roth). My informed guess is that they are both from the Gulf of Carpentaria. They could be compared to the Pitt Rivers Museum object PRM1989_46_8. Based on the distribution of Banksia dentata the materials harvesting for the manufacture of these objects was conceivably Binbinka Country and its vicinity or one of the Wik Countries.

There was a ceremonial exchange of message sticks for permission to be on country. This is the one that the school principle gave to Shannon Bauwens and Shannon gave another one to the school principle.

NAWARLAGABARNMANG	A message stick found at Nawarla Gabarnmang	 	The site was excavated by Robert Gunn who wrote: "The sandy floor of the shelter, although in places disturbed by trampling buffalo, contained a wide range of surface artefacts, including a wooden spearthrower, wooden clap-stick (musical instrument), wooden message stick, tin sheet, and several ground stone axe-heads (Figs 6.10 and 6.11), as well as a range of stone flakes and worked wooden points. On the basis of the very high archaeological potential of the floor deposits, I suggested to the Jawoyn Association that they engage Dr Bruno David, an eminently qualified excavation archaeologist at Monash University, to undertake an excavation programme here and at other nearby sites."—Gunn, Robert. 2017.

"There'll be a moment of suspense for World Council of Churches representatives who approach the worhip tent where the WCA assembly begins in February: wil they be allowed in? The answer to that question will be made from the front stage of the tent, where, already seated, Aboriginal elders and clergy will consider the request, carried to them on a message stick. Should it seem like a fair thing, an elder will beckon to the waiting WC procession, who may then enter. In this act, as throughout the 15-day gathering, ti will be abundantly clear to all who participate that they are on Aboriginal land. Caretakers and custodians, it is the aboriginal people who will finlly permit the event, and purify it according to custom.

VMZ_06806	A message stick from Queensland in the Völkerkundemuseum der Universität Zürich (VMZ)	 	This message stick is part of a collection of 189 objects sent from the National Gallery of Victoria to the Schweizerisches Landesmuseum in Zürich, as noted on 31 May 1926.   On this date, Spencer wrote to the Director, Scheizerisches Landesmuseum, Zurich: "Dear Sir, On his return from Europe where he had visited the Museum at Zurich my friend Professor Lodewyck discussed with us the question of sending to you a collection of specimens illustrating the Ethnology of Australian tribes in return for one from your Museum containing specimens from the Swiss Lake Dwellings. I also received the photographs that you were good enough to send. I am enclosing a list ofthe specimens which have been selected and will be forwarded to you as soon as possible from Melbourne. It is now difficult to procure genuine examples of many implements etc. but all of those sent are genuine. We shall be glad to receive the Swiss Lake Dwellings specimens from your Museum and leave the selection of these in your hands.  Believe me, Yours faithfully,  W. Baldwin Spencer. Director"  The message stick is listed on digital page 12 as follows: "Registered number 13250. Message stick. Queensland".    PK corresponded with Dr. Andreas Isler in October and November 2021 about the possibility that this message stick was collected by Walter Roth on Kalkatungu country given the striking similarity to one of Roth's sketches (WER1897PXVIIIF332). Having found an image of the reverse side of the object it appears that it is not the same, but the similarity remains, and may have been created in the same location.

Shield, club, boomerang, and notched stick, from Queensland [60] Australia. The small notched stick was a message from some natives on an island in Moreton Bay, to whom Mr. Dodds of Humpy Bong had applied for help in crushing sugar cane. The notches on one side represented the number of men that would be sent, those on the other, the number of days they would be sent in. Speaking of these message sticks Mr. Brough-Smythe says :—"The Australians, according to the statements made by my correspondents and confirmed by the evidence I have produced, could really send messages, describe the events of a journey, and furnish details of a kin likely to be useful to their friends. It is not without interest and importance that one of their message-sticks should have been produced in a court of justice in Queensland and interpreted by a native trooper."

MVat100644	A message stick from New Norcia, WA, in Mvsei Vaticani (Vatican museums)	 	Online catalog description:"Bastonicino messaggio.    Le vie di scambio attraversavano tutta l'Australia, dalle regioni tropicali del nord a quelle alpine del sud, fino alle pianure desertiche del centro e alle estese coste occidentali. La sopravvivenza in un continente così vasto e diverso dipendeva dagli spostamenti e dagli scambi di cibo e di risorse su lunghe distanze, e anche dagli obblighi matrimoniali e cerimoniali. Reti complesse operavano tramite relazioni di parentela, associazioni totemiche, legami di discendenza e responsabilità verso il proprio territorio. Tutto questo riduceva anche la conflittualità e il rischio di guerre tra clan vicini.  I bastoncini messaggio erano uno strumento di comunicazione. Incisi con punti e linee angolari, erano portati da messaggeri o circolavano tra i diversi clan e gruppi linguistici per trasmettere informazioni e messaggi, ad esempio inviti per un corroboree o per un incontro. Dopo la colonizzazione gli spostamenti degli Aborigeni hanno subito forti limitazioni e i percorsi tradizionali sono stati sbarrati dalle recinzioni. Grazie alla loro profonda conoscenza del territorio alcuni aborigeni furono presi a lavorare come postini, portando le lettere inglesi nel territorio regionale e si conoscono casi in cui bastoncini messaggio come questi furono portati a destinazione nelle borse dei postini inglesi.

The Conversation, 8 October. https://theconversation.com/what-are-message-sticks-senator-lidia-thorpe-continues-a-long-and-powerful-diplomatic-tradition-147674.    On 21 March 2023, Senator Thorpe brought the stick back again. Here is the relevant excerpt from Hansard for that day: "Senator THORPE (Victoria) (16:20): First Nations deaths in custody are a national crisis. In 1991 we had a royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody, yet here we are, 32 years later, more than a generation later, and more and more of our people are dying in custody instead of there being an end to this crisis. When I first walked into this chamber, I carried this message stick, engraved with one line for each death in custody since the royal commission, which was supposed to put an end—  The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Polley): Senator Thorpe, you know very well that we don't allow props to be used in the chamber. I would ask you—  Senator THORPE: I was allowed to bring it in when I walked in to be sworn in— The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT: That was when you walked in.  Senator THORPE: There were 441 deaths in custody when I walked into this place. [908]  The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Senator Thorpe, I ask you to be seated. Senator Thorpe: Now we've got over 500.  The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT: Senator Thorpe, are you going to continue? Senator Thorpe: Yes. Can I continue?  The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT: You can continue.  Senator THORPE: That stick, when I walked in here, had 441 deaths in custody on it. Now we have over 540 deaths in custody. At least back in 1991 this got public attention—but not now. Nobody wants to know about it, even though Labor's own father of reconciliation, Senator Dodson, has called the government out about its inaction. In the last three decades, we have seen government after government letting us down, clearly showing that they don't care. You didn't care, and now you don't care. Each and every one of those lives matter to us and to many people. Some of those people whose lives you threw away were not even sentenced or held for even minor offences, as was the case with Tanya Day, who was arrested because she put her feet on the train seat. She died because she put her feet on the train seat! A whitefella wouldn't be arrested for that.  Labor and the coalition are in a race to the bottom to be tough on crime. However, we all know that social factors are first and foremost in determining crime rates. Most of the recommendations of the royal commission were about social factors to make sure that our people are not being left behind. Every government comes up with new buzzwords on how they are going to deal with black people in this country—'closing the gap'—and they introduce advisory body after advisory body, yet there are no changes on the ground.  More of our people are being incarcerated, more people are dying in custody and more of our people are taking their lives. I talk to blackfellas in prisons, and they tell me about the hanging points. They tell me exactly where the hanging points are in the prison cells. The recommendation talks about the hanging points in these cells, and these young men are telling me where they are and how they tell each other how to hang themselves!  You can't blame them; what does their future look like in this country? The system knows about these hanging points, but nothing is being done; it isn't a problem if another one of us dies. Worst of all are the privately operated prisons—those operated by the criminal Serco, which the government loves having on board and paying. Serco are the real criminals here; they're the ones hurting and killing our people. All this is allowed because there is still wide- ranging systemic racism in this country. It's in all institutions, but first and foremost in the police. Police violence against First Nations people is off the chart in this country.  All your voices to parliament and all your closing the gap gammon statements are all worth nothing, because you ain't saving our people's lives in this country. So do it! Get the 339 recommendations from the royal commission that this country paid for and implement them now. Black lives matter in this country! Stop killing us!

SAM_AA_298_4_2_3	Sketch of a message stick  made by W. R. Pennifold belonging to Batjamalh region	 	This sketch is from a letter written to N. B. Tindale dated 26 November 1927. The full letter is as follows:  "Transcription of: AA298/4/2/3  Message Sticks N Territory by Pennifold  Answered 2.4.28  And sent reprint  E.E.T.b. Darwin  Nov. 26th 1927  Dear Tindale,  Probably you are wondering what has become of me as its over 12 months since I left the “Garden City” and after 5 months in Singapore managed to get a transfer to Darwin + here I am (married at last) + will be here for another 18 months or perhaps longer.   Well I often think of the Entomologists in Adelaide + although I don’t get much time for collecting the wily insect I never miss the opportunity of popping an unwily Coleoptera into the odd spot of alcohol.  My chief reason for pushing this pen is to let you into a little information which I acquired from an old Larakera nigger which will probably interest you. Perhaps you will recall [1] the very pleasant evening spent at the Anthropological Society’s meeting, the subject being “Aboriginal message sticks. Since my arrival in Darwin I’ve kept a sharp lookout for these “Message Sticks” but for some unknown reason they appear to be very uncommon + the only one I’ve managed to acquire – if it really is one – being one I found in the bush slighly charred by a bush fire. Nearby I also found a broken spear. I wil endeavour to sketch the stick to give you some idea of what its like.   On showing it to my nigger who belongs to the Wogite tribe he unhesitatingly informed me that it had come from his country, but on being asked what it meant he said; “Him all same letter”, after several futile attempts [2] to get him to read its meaning to me he said; “No more read this one Boss.” “Can other Blackboy read him?” “No more.”  This puzzled me, so I made further enquiries, but although several natives informed me that it was all same letter, none of them made any attempt to read it.   The other evening I was questioning an old Larrakera boy who is far above the average native in intelligence + his English is quite good for a native. On my telling him that I knew a man (Prof. Wood-Jones) who was very interested in these sticks he wanted to know if I meant Spencer. He remembers when the Darwin-Pine-Ck railway was built, when China-town consisted of bark-huts, in fact he is most intelligent for an abo. Probably because he has [3] been associated with whites most of his life.  Well, I asked him if he could make message sticks + he informed me that the message sticks his tribe made were merely tokens. Perhaps it would be better if I wrote this as the conversation actually took place. “One man he sit down + makeim stick then he burn mark on wood with red-hot wire. By-+-by he give this stick to another black-boy + tell him take it alonga so-and-so + tell him I bin send it + that I want matches, flour or anything else like that. When my friend bin receive this stick he say to boy. “Who bin sendum this one, eh?” “Berber bin sendum this one: Well what him want, eh? Then he tell him I want matches + flour.”  I then told Berber (the old abo) that some blacks can read [4] these sticks the same as a white man reads a letter.  “Yes I sabby that too Boss but no more alonga my tribe, or Melville Is, Wogite, Woolma Brengan boy, but black-fella longa Daly Waters, Powells Crk, Boorooloola + other side him plenty sabby.” “Can you read their message sticks Berber?” “I only sabby one fella.” “And what’s that?” “When him makum three spots that mean big row” “What big fight Eh?” “Yes, big fight.”  “Well why don’t your tribe + the tribes about here make these letter sticks eh? “We no bin learn ‘em” “What about long time ago b4 white-man come here?” “No more we neber bin learn’em all about here.” “Why haven’t your tribe learnt it? “I dunno Boss.”  Well Tindale you can see by that, that Christie who [5] got up that night at the meeting + said that the natives couldn’t read these sticks as he had made them himself for the blacks, was correct in what he said for he was speaking of Point Charles which is only 15 miles from Darwin, + the sticks made by those natives are not “message sticks but “token” sticks.  Personally I think that this is rather a valuable piece of information + something for you to work on, if you haven’t already heard of it.  You may if you wish make use of this letter at the Anthropological Socys. meeting  It appears to me that this hieroglyphical art was first learnt in the South + gradually worked its way Nth.  Perhaps it orginated in Victoria where the Cohuna [?] [6] skulls have come from. It would be very interesting to trace in what part of Australia this art had reached its highest standard when the white race arrived.  Well Tindale I must close this, if there is anything I could do to assist you or Mr. Lea in any way, just let me know + I will be only too pleased to do it.   Of course I’m now looking for an Abo who hails from the vicinity of Daly Waters who can make the real message sticks. I do hope that the above will prove of interest to you if not of any value. Give my kindest regards to Mr. Lea + his wife not forgetting yourself.  Sincerely yrs.  W.R.

JEDDA1955	A messenger with a message stick represented in the 1955 film 'Jedda' after 01:17:30	asynchronous	Video excerpt runs from 1:11:47 until 1:15:28.    Having abducted Jedda, Marbuck travels with her down the river where he meets the tribal council. He is presented with a message stick and 'reads' it silently (the messenger says nothing). As if following the instructions on the stick he goes up towards the group of old men who exile him for having taken a woman of the wrong skin.    Later, at 1:15:10, the narrator says:    "The message stick tells Marbuck that the old men's council will talk to him on the Bora ground above the river"	 	 	 	 	Fictional message stick	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/watch/612877891878	 	 	 	 	Piers Kelly	1955_JEDDA_excerpt_from_1_11_47.mp4;JEDDA1955_still_image.png

What this image appears to represent is an equivalence between the written word and the message stick. Another interpretation is that the man on the left is holding a tjurunga (sacred objects that Arrernte people at Hermannsberg decided to abandon) and the man on the right is holding a Bible which is shown as replacing traditional spiritual beliefs. The catalogue information, however, describes the cartoon as depicting a message stick. "	Piers Kelly	SAM_AA662_95_2_1-Albrecht_cartoon-a.jpg;SAM_AA662_95_2_1-Albrecht_cartoon-b.jpg

ADELAIDE1967	A message stick listed on US eBay in 2022 with images of a naked man and woman	 	From seller fyrfytrh8sfyr: "AUSTRALIAN MESSAGE STICK Man & woman nudes ~late 19th to mid-20th century    Vintage Australian Message Stick ~ Male & Female nude art    10" x 1-5/8" x 1/8" (see photos)    Extremely rare, most likely late 1800s to mid 1900s.  This amazing historical artifact is extremely rare, in that it depicts a female nude on one side with a male nude on the other. There is no telling evidence of what the nudes are depicting. It could be ritualistic, sexual in nature, or maybe a message of pregnancy in the female?   This piece is beautifully thin, but almost inflexible hard wood. It also has a very aged and smooth shiny texture. What a great piece of historical art!"

According to NMA: "This collection comprises material displayed at the Presbyterian Church's 1928 Australian Inland Mission (AIM) Frontier Fete and Exhibition, an event held over three days in April 1928 in Sydney's Town Hall. The collection includes a diverse range of the objects displayed there, as well as some of the associated display labels. These objects were selected by staff, principally women, working at AIM homes/hospitals in different parts of Australia. They were responding to a call to send in objects which '... will give the city dweller an opportunity of visualising more clearly the conditions of inland Australia'. The collection relates to a significant moment in the history of the AIM. It co-incides with the beginning of the Aerial Medical Service and the introduction of the Traeger pedal radios - technologies which would shape how 'pioneer' life in 'remote' Australia became part of Australia's national identity. AIM events, such as the 1928 Frontier Fete and Exhibition, were important in promoting the work of the AIM. They acted as a focus for AIM's metropolitan supporters, as well as raising funds for AIM activities. The Aboriginal objects in this collection show that despite AIM being set up to provide a 'mantle of safety' for non-Indigenous Australians living in remote locations, many of these AIM nursing homes were enmeshed in complex relationships with local Aboriginal communities."

When Buma-buma reached the distant camp he demanded, in the name of his father, two girls instead of two boys. Though the old men agreed to the demand, they were somewhat suspicious of the unusual request. On nearing Wialpa, Buma-buma, hiding the girls in the jungle, told his father that the old men of the distant people wanted at least another year before their youths were ready for circumcision. The father, who did not believe that story, demanded more and further more details, until Buma-buma was forced to admit he had brought girls instead of boys. The men, and especially the father, were so enraged over Buma-buma's disobedience and its consequent disgrace that they speared the young man to death. After the burial rituals of Buma-buma, the men at Wialpa were so ashamed of his actions that they changed themselves into water-birds, which still live in the nearby fresh-water swamps.  At the present time the ceremonial message stick on which the figure of Buma-buma is engraved, is sent to a group of aborigines who have a boy ready for circumcision. Although the designs on the stick refer specifically to the death and burial of Buma-buma, and not to circumcision, the myth of Buma-buma's disobedience and punishment is so well known that the significance of the message stick is understood." p. 471.

DL wrote (25.03.2023): "My father's mother's father was James Waltham Curtis, a highly regarded artist in Melbourne in the late 1800s. He did landscapes, illustrations for newspapers and for a period was employed by Stanford of American university fame. Yesterday I was showing a friend my collection of copies of his artworks and came across the attached, which I'd completely forgotten was in the collection. It's highly unlikely the picture was an eyewitness account as there's no evidence James was ever on Dagworth station or in Queensland (he was mostly in Victoria, but did visit Tasmania, New Guinea, New Zealand and various pacific islands). I suspect it was done as a newspaper illustration. The caption doesn't really fit as the men are holding 'paper yabber', not a 'flag of truce', which more likely would be a green branch."  The associated newspaper article is "THE BLACKS AT DAGWORTH STATION. QUEENSLAND." Illustrated Australian News (Melbourne, Vic. : 1876 - 1889) 23 January 1878: 10. Web. 27 Mar 2023 <http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60096235>.    PK: Part of the misunderstanding of the paper yabbers as flags of surrender may be premised on the fact that such objects, like message sticks on the end of a spear, where indeed intended to signal "I come in peace"	Piers Kelly	JWC1878.png

Berndt, Love Songs of Arnhem Land, 1978: Addendum: ‘Love-Magic Objects’, 192–94.] The ‘Love Magic Object’ illustrated by the Berndts in 1950 fits also with their description of the message string sent to notify of a death (said to ‘contain part of the deceased person’s spirit’): the feathered string attached to the bird’s head being similarly arranged to form the body and wings (Fig. 8.18).[fn:82: Elkin et al., Art in Arnhem Land, 1950: 88.]" 284    McKenzie, Robyn Elizabeth. 2016.

AGWA1988_0554	Message Board by ABADJERA	interpreted_artefact  named_creator  kinship	AGWA description: "Message boards and sticks are used primarily as memory aids. A person who wants to send a message to another will make the board or stick, explain what it means to the messenger, so when he arrives he will use it as a guide to his memory. Message sticks are also used to identify the tribesmen that a ceremony is to be held, or to invite them to other types of gatherings. According to Father Worms, this message board, called "Tambul" was given to a boy for his initiation. The trip was to alert and invite members of the clan and blood relatives that the ceremony was to be held. The board is ornamented with parrot feathers. The totemic symbol of the boy is painted with ochres; in this case, the Barramundi and the Portugese man-of-war fish. Before he makes his trip, the meaning of the rangga emblem and designs are explained to the boy. These totemic emblems will also be a feature of the initiation ceremonies. Exhibited: Lowie: R.H.

He had had personal contact with Aboriginal people throughout his life, from when he was a small boy in Queensland and, from the late 1860s, in New South Wales. This contact may have led him to recording the names of Aboriginal people associated with particular objects in his collection, at a time when this was rarely done. Milne seems to have begun actively collecting Indigenous artefacts in the early 1880s and was still acquiring objects a few months before his death in 1917. His work with the NSW Railways (1876-1917) enabled him to meet a broad range of people who facilitated his collecting and associated activities like visiting Aboriginal sites. From at least the time he lived at Orange NSW (1906-1915), and later at Ryde (1915-1917), near to Sydney city, he displayed his collection at his home. In addition to a large collection of Aboriginal artefacts, Milne's collection included artefacts from the South Pacific and prehistoric implements from Egypt, France and England. In his will dated 12 December 1916, Milne bequeathed his “Anthropological collection” to the “first Federal Museum opened in the Federal Capital”. The collection remained at Ryde until early 1931 when it was acquired by the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. It remained there until the Institute's collections were transferred to the National Museum of Australia in 1985."	Nitzan Rotman	NMA1985_0059_0392_01.png

When a message such as this is received it means that there are two lines about 50 to 60 yards apart denoting the boundary of each tribe, the first of the aboriginals who oversteps that mark or line gives the sign for War and a battle ensues. The stick in question was used in a fight between the "Cumio" and the "Marirumbo" [?or Mari-uimbo] tribes, the first named being Queenslanders and the latter South Australians found around the surroundings of Lake Nash". Lake Nash is in the Northern Territory and not South Australia. It is possible this note was written while the Northern Territory was part of South Australia (until 1911). Edmund Milne (1861-1917) was born in England and emigrated to Queensland with his parents 19 months later. He had had personal contact with Aboriginal people throughout his life, from when he was a small boy in Queensland and, from the late 1860s, in New South Wales.

Date of letter sent by Amberleigh Griffiths-Marsh (Amber) to Piers Kelly:  "Dear Dr Kelly,   I have just watched the third programme in the 'First Inventors' series on SBS On Demand. I have to say that the whole series has been fascinating, and has answered a number of questions I have thought about over the years.    The specific programme I refer to here is the third one, when Message Sticks were studied.    My father was given a message stick by an elder when he was training with the Z Specials (forerunner of today's SAS) in Darwin and usrrounds in readiness for his insertion into Borneo in the middle of 1945. (I include a copy of his book herewith for you. It has been so long since I read it that I do not know if he mentions receiving the message stick but it will give you context for the gift).    He had always treasured the message stick, but had no idea what the markings meant. I had a friend take it to the Gumurri centres at both Mg Gravatt and Nathan campuses of Griffith University, hoping that someone whould be able to decipher the stick, to no avail.     I include it here, and since dad died in 2012, I would like to make it a donation to your collection. No-on else is interested in it, and I don't want it thrown away when I die.    The only thing I ask, is that if at all possible, you or one of your research assistants or other interested party would send me the information that the stick holds. I would reaslly love to know what it says, even a bit of its history, eg, when and where and by whom was it made.     I know that dad would value the idea that it is in safe hands. He donated all his war memorabilia to the National War Museum, where he has his own display. We both value continuity, and preservation of istory, of personal and world history, big or small.    Thank you for the work you are doing, we need to understand more about our First Naitons as it is relevant and important o the forward direction of Australia.    Yours faithfully,    Amber Griffiths-Marsh      20.09.23: PK in conversation with June Ross who suggested that the motifs represented yams, since this is similar to how yams appear in rock art and yams are an important motif in the Kimberley and Top End. She also mentioned that pokerwork style is typical of central Australia but is unusual to be in the Top End in the 1940s. Text discussing the yam motif is the thesis:  Hammond, Judith W. 2016. Yam Culture in Arnhem Land: An analysis of cultural life related to Dioscorea yams from the ‘Yam Figure’ rock paintings to the present day. Armidale: University of New England MA dissertation.    27.10.23:PK:  Possible that Roland Griffiths-Marsh travelled on the HMAS Arunta which also held message sticks. In his book he spells it Aronda (I think)    22.11.23: Compare yam motif with pokerwork on other objects eg British Museum acc no. 1942 Oc 3 3    	Piers Kelly	GRIFFITHS_MARSH1945_01.JPG;GRIFFITHS_MARSH1945_02.JPG

Commentary: "Message Sticks, Milimili, Ngarluma People, Northwestern Western Australia, Australia. ‘Message sticks’, as they are generally known, are fascinating Aboriginal artefacts. These cut, barked and decoratively carved sticks contain no message than can be ‘read’ like writing; instead, they were used more like medieval wax seals, or modern signatures. Used in many different parts of the Australian continent, and differently made in each Aboriginal culture, each man developed his own set of message stick marks, which became recognisable to his wide circle of friends, relatives and diplomatic contacts. When the man needed to send a messenger to one of these contacts, he would mark up a stick with his insignia, select a male relative to relay the message, and send him off with the message stick as evidence of the message being genuine. In certain circumstances, message sticks could also act as a kind of passport, showing that the traveller was under the owner’s protection, and ought to be given safe passage through his territories.

HMG25_3	A message stick held in the Horniman Museum and Gardens (UK)	localized_artefact	A message stick (milimili). The stick is divided into sections with incised lines. Each section contains incised lines or dots.    Commentary: Message Sticks, Milimili, Ngarluma People, Northwestern Western Australia, Australia. ‘Message sticks’, as they are generally known, are fascinating Aboriginal artefacts. These cut, barked and decoratively carved sticks contain no message than can be ‘read’ like writing; instead, they were used more like medieval wax seals, or modern signatures. Used in many different parts of the Australian continent, and differently made in each Aboriginal culture, each man developed his own set of message stick marks, which became recognisable to his wide circle of friends, relatives and diplomatic contacts. When the man needed to send a messenger to one of these contacts, he would mark up a stick with his insignia, select a male relative to relay the message, and send him off with the message stick as evidence of the message being genuine. In certain circumstances, message sticks could also act as a kind of passport, showing that the traveller was under the owner’s protection, and ought to be given safe passage through his territories.

DFAT_002_DF_D00031011	Unidentified Mornington Island man carving a message stick	localized_artefact	AIATSIS: Printed on verso: Australian scientists have uncovered further evidence that Australia's Aborigines may have had their origins on the Indian sub-continent. A four-year survey among Aborigines in remote Arnhem Land, in the Northern Territory has revealed work habits and dexterity patterns of traditional craftsmen which fit closely those of certain tribal groups in southern India and Ceylon, including the Sinhalese and descendants of the Veddas in Ceylon. The discovery is the latest in a recent series of finds supporting a number of theories as to the origin of Australia's Aborigines. It was made by Professor Leslie M. Haynes, head of the Department of Industrial Arts at the University of New South Wales, Sydney. Professor Haynes, an ethno-technologist, made intensive studies of Aboriginal craftsmen during an Australian Government project to ascertain the industrial aptitudes of the Aborigines. The research lasted four years, during which time Professor Haynes was also engaged on similar work for the Smithsonian Institute of Washington among tribal groups in Ceylon and India	 	 	 	 	Image of a message stick and messenger	 	QLD	 	 	 	 	The message stick is associated with Mornington Island, Queensland, Australia	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	16°30'56.5"S	139°24'18.2"E	Coordinates for Mornington Island, Queensland, per Google maps	 	 	 	 	 	 	Piers Kelly  Nitzan Rotman	DFAT_002_DF_D00031011.jpg

This would be mounted on a heavy stick with gum; when worn out, it would be reversed. From Woomera, South Australia. As far as is known, no other natives in the world mounted a sharp (unground) stone on to a heavy handle and used it as an adze. (2) Set of three worn out tuhlas from Woomera. (3) Set of three spear points. Worora tribe, 400 miles north of Broome,W.A. (4) Surgical knife, from Mulka, South Australia. (5) Set of two surgical knives. Mulka, South Australia. (6) Surgical knife from Darwin, North Australia. (7) Doctor's knife, from Broome, Western Australia. (8) Mounted knife, from Arunta tribe, Central Australia. (9) Set of three knives, from Woomera, South Australia. (10) Set of three Crescents, from Woomera, South Australia. Use unknown by natives. (11) Set of three Microlith knives. South coast of N.S.W.

(21) Woman's knife ( wood), from Loritja tribe, Central Aus´?¢tralia. (22) Knife made from a bailer shell from Bentick Island. There was no stone on that island, and I have seen a movie film of the natives biting the shell. Since then, all the fresh water on the island was spoiled by sea waves, and the natives have been moved to Mornington Island, in the Gulf. (23) Mounted hammer stone from Aurukun, Queensland. No suitable stone there, so this was traded and mounted as a treasure. (24) Woman's knife, Arunta tribe, Central Australia. (25) Tool for grooving a spear to insert a glass or stone point. Mapocin, Northern Territory. (26) Large quartzite knife from Sir Baldwyn Spencer's collection. Central Australia. (27) Crude knife, from Kimberley district, Western Australia.

Documented titled: "Re: Accession 1983.002"  "In 1983 Museum Curator, Tania Konecny, completed a restrospective accessioning of the ethnographic objects in the Folk Museum. The objects were described (including in many cases a drawing of the object), measured and assigned a place of origin and numbered.  The following objects were deaccessioned [...]  Donors were attributed in a few instances. In these cases, although most had no original documentaiton, the attribution of donors through Konecny's research was accepted [...]  52 objects were identified as being from the estate of JB (John Bruce) Sandilands. The Sandilands estate was given in 1958 according to the Folk Museum Accession Register 1954-1975. These with four additional objects have been reaccessioned as 1958.009.  In all renumbering, the 1983.0002 number has been retained as an other alternate number. it is important to also note that Konecny's retrospective accessioning included numbering the object!  The donor attribution of the rest of 1983.002 was penciled in by Konecny as possibly being either from JB Sandlisands or AH Perrot. However the following Aboriginal and Islander artefacts were also given to the Armidale Museum from 1931-1950. As there was no listing or other documentation, the 1983.002 ethnographic objects may also have come from these donors or even other as yet undiscovered donors. These remain in 1983.002 with sources and acquisition dates recorded as unknown: " There are no Aboriginal items listed after this and no additional pages.      Explaining the discrepancy with the accession number inscribed on the object and its official accession number, SR at AFM wrote "the object number is 1983.2.75, previously objects were numbered without the first number of the year of accessioning"   	Piers Kelly	AFM1983_2_75_01.jpeg;AFM1983_2_75_02.jpeg;AFM1983_2_75_03.jpeg;AFM1983_2_75_04.jpeg;AFM1983_2_75_05.jpeg;AFM1983_2_75_06.jpeg

Decorated with parallel incised vertical grooves and transverse grooves that cross each other. The incised figures have their meaning, they convey certain messages"    Additional info NMVW online catalogue (listed in English): "A short stick of light coloured wood with a series of short, narrow grooves or notches, 'V'-shaped in section, cut along the sides giving the piece of wood a quadrangular cross section. These cuts are reminiscent of 'tally grooves', and of the series of short grooves found on rock engraving sites in the Grafton district of the Clarence valley, and in north-eastern South Australia. Such rock engravings are not found in the Richmond River district. The longer grooves on the message sticks are cut on nopposed sides (nineteen on one, twenty on the other) as are also the shorter grooves (fourteen on one side, thirteen on the other). The message stick measures 9.9 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm. The pair of message sticks is a unique specimen. No other examples from this ara are known, and there is only one reference to their use in the local literature. Bray (1923:7) mentions that 'messages from tribe to tribe were carried verbally except very important ones. This [sic] were marked on a stick by means of notches'. To the south we have records of their use at Port Stephens (Scott 1929:33-4), but unfortunately no description of their features. To the north in Queensland such stick were used, and there are surviving examples in the Queensland Museum's collections. Some of these bear notches, as do the Richmond River specimens, though the particular examples do not come from south-east Queensland (see Hamlyn-Harris 1918:19, 20, 26, 27). Such message sticks apparently served a double purpose; they were 'memory sticks' for the bearer, and guarantees of his good faith as he travelled through the territory of different tribal groups. There seems to be little information on their use in eastern New South Wales, though they are reasonably well documented for other areas such as the Darling basin and central Australi (Hamlyn-Harris 1918; Howitt 1904:678-710)."

They were usually not particularly elaborately made, as they were usually only used once. The most common characters found on messenger staffs are notches carved either on the edge or on the surface of the staff. Most of the time, the messengers with messenger staffs were heads of local groups who wanted to invite neighboring Aborigines to festivals and gatherings, for example to hunts for emus and wallabies, initiation rites or Cooroborees (dance festivals). Messenger staffs could also be sent between individuals to request the production of special equipment, weapons, etc., or to initiate barter transactions. Some messenger sticks contained information about illnesses and deaths. They could also send warnings about the arrival of enemy groups or declarations of war to settle disputes. Each messenger staff contained at the same time the authentication of the messenger and the truthfulness of his message. In many cases, the symbols on the messenger staff served as a reminder to the messenger. Unfortunately, no records are known about the messenger staff of the Herrnhut Ethnological Museum. However, since the origin of the object was attributed to the area around the Aurukun mission station (North Queensland), C.Erckenbrecht suspects a connection to an event from 1911: Christmas celebrations at the mission stations were very popular among the Aborigines. Large groups of Aborigines often arrived at the mission station for this festival. But since they didn't have a calendar, some groups came to the festival too early in 1911 and left again because nothing happened. Missionary Richter had a messenger sent after them with the message to come back in seven days, then it would be Christmas. He gave the messenger a messenger staff with seven notches, one for each remaining day. (VMH, JF 2020)"    This record represents the longer object out of the two in the attached image.

JF2013	A message stick made by the Beagle Bay community as part of the March for Life 2013 (handed to Josie Farrer, member for Kimberley)	interpreted_artefact  parliament  political	Beagle Bay - March for Life - Crafted from a Kimberley medicine tree, this message stick is known as ‘The Baton of Life’ and was historically presented to the Parliament of Western Australia in 2013. The message contained within the markings symbolises profound loss by the families of Beagle Bay, who have been touched by suicide. Nine of the lines represent a family who has felt the devastation of losing a family member, whilst the tenth represents all of the people of the Kimberley. The sun symbolises the giver of life and hope for the future. The Beagle Bay community presented it to member for Kimberley, Josie Farrer, at a March for Life on 17 September 2013. Ms Farrer was asked by the community to carry the message stick and accompanying petition to State Parliament. It is hoped that this powerful symbol will convey the need for better approaches, greater supports and a pathway to healing.    The Petition - Josie presented the petition and message stick to Parliament on 23 October 2013. The petition, signed by six people from the Beagle Bay community, asked for the Parliament of Western Australia to ‘take immediate and effective action to address this tragic loss of life in the Kimberley’. In presenting the petition and message stick, Josie said, ‘this baton tells a very sad story but, hopefully, with the symbol of the sun, the giver of life, it will give hope to members of the family in understanding why they have lost loved ones’. Read the petition.    Parliamentary Inquiry - On 16 March 2016, Josie Farrer moved a motion for a parliamentary inquiry to determine ‘what more can be done to halt the worrying number of youth suicides amongst Aboriginal youth in Western Australia, particularly in remote communities, and to determine what resources have been set aside to tackle this crucial issue facing our state’. The Education and Health Standing Committee inquiry report 'Learning from the Message Stick - The Report of the Inquiry into Aboriginal youth suicide in remote areas' was tabled along with the Message Stick by the Committee Chair, Dr Graham Jacobs, MLA on 17 November 2016. The report recommended options to reduce suicide rates and improve the quality of life for remote communities like, Beagle Bay. In tabling the report, Dr Jacobs said – The message stick has been described as ‘the baton of life’ in the hope that it will encourage better approaches to suicide prevention, and I table it today … in recognition of the Aboriginal voices that contributed to the committee’s work.    The Message Stick - The message stick is a form of communication between groups of Aboriginal people across Australia and used to pass on information such as announcements of ceremonies, meetings, warnings, disputes and events with all messages painted and inscribed on a stick and carried by one messenger.    The elders grant the messenger safe passage to travel through other nation’s territories to deliver a message to their people or to spread it further beyond their land.    Message Stick Display - The message stick has been placed on display in the Aboriginal People’s Gallery within Parliament House, in recognition of the cultural importance to the Parliament of the voice of the Beagle Bay community in speaking up about Aboriginal suicide.    Members of the public are able to see the message stick by joining a public tour of the Parliament.	 	2013	 	 	Message stick in a private collection	political	Western Australia	 	 	 	 	 	 	"The message contained within the markings symbolises profound loss by the families of Beagle Bay, who have been touched by suicide.

 	A reference to the absence of message sticks among the Kurnai	negative_text_reference	"In the matter of message sticks I have been at work for a long time. I have secured some which I will send to you. After I have made careful drawings of them for future use. I have not yet found one instance where the marks upon them convey any meaning by the blacks from which [insert] whom [end insert] they have been obtained. They say the marks are only for ornament and that the “stick” is more of a token to accredit the messenger. This does not disprove the positive statements made eg by Mr Dawson that in some places the marks have a meaning. So far I cannot find an instance either in South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales or Victoria. Message sticks were not known to or used by the Kurnai. The messenger sometimes carried a boomerang, shield or spear as a token from the sender of the message."   —Howitt, A. W. 1882. “Letter from A.W.

I've attached here the cataloguing we have for Lauri's Yir Yorront collections, there are three separate subcollections (for reasons that are unclear, although one is earlier in date of donation). The first, from 1973, has photos as part of the records but the ones from 1983 do not. There are two pieces catalogued as memory sticks, but I don't think they're the two referenced in your Alpher note: they are cylindrical, pale soft wood, both with similar more-or-less diagonal cuts all around the full length. There also is a piece that looks to me like a bull-roarer that had surface carvings. I can supply photos of any you may need to see, just let me know (I promise to be faster in responding!). And of course happy to get any information that we might add, and to work with you if return is appropriate. I did take a look at the pieces in the more recent donation, and checked with the Library (which transferred them to us), and not only are they not well provenienced but there are no memory sticks.

The timber for the message stick was sourced by Ben from Lake Condah in 2021, continuing the many thousands of years of cultural practice of making message sticks and reviving this in contemporary ways. Pre-contact a message stick would have been carved with a sharp and durable stone tool and or mussel shell but today Ben etched both sides with a Dremel engraver and an electronic burner. An archival ink paint pen was used for the artwork, and it was sealed with a mix of linseed oil and mineral turpentine. Contemporary Cultural practice is important to the ongoing and thriving living culture of First Peoples of Victoria, the message stick from Ben speaks to the history of his Ancestors and communicates the message to us today of the cultural strength of the Kerrupjmara people that continues and that many future generations of First Peoples will learn from and connect to."

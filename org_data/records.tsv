[ZM 14/02/2013]    This is probably one of the object mentioned in a letter from Howitt [Howitt 10] of the Tylor papers PRM ms collections Box 12 of June 25 1883:     'Dear Dr Tylor Your letter of the 13th May reminds me that I have not yet sent the turndun which I promised in my last letter. The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net "yamma" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him. The old man showeed mine to my correspondent with much mystery after sending all the women away from the place    These are all the contributions which I can send you this time but more will follow as soon as I can get them drawn -- I do this because I cannot yet tell whether in the work for which I am gathering materials I may or may not require illustrations of these things. This will not however in any way affect any use to which you may decide to put them. They are yours to do with as you like. If there are any other blackfellows implements which you want I shall be delighted to try and obtain them for you.

In Thorpe (1909) 'Australian tribal names with their synonyms', 'Mundainbura' is noted as "North of Denham Range Queensland" which would place it in the vicinity of the Barna language. Other languages that match the general geographic vicinity are Wiri and Yambina.     However, in Howitt's text which ought to be considered more reliable, the message stick comes from the Dawson river (p. 325) which is further south, and his correspondent is from Durham Downs which would place the language in the vicinity of the Mandandanji language. This is closer to 'Mundainbura' given that -bura is typically a toponymic suffix in many Queensland languages. 	 	"My correspondent Mr. W. Logan, of Durham Downs, says of this stick as follows: "the notches in the upper edge represent a number of men of the Kūrgila class of the tribe. The two rows of dots below represent men respectively of the Kŭnbe and Wūngu classes. The notches on the lower edge represent men of the Kuburu class. The message with it was to invite these people to a corroboree." (p. 325)    In writing to a valued correspondent, Mr. R. Christison, of Lammermoor Station, on the subject of message sticks, I submitted to him a sketch of the Mundainbura message sticks with a request that he would ascertain what the men living with him of the Dalebura tribe could make of it; the Dalebura tribe has the same class divisions as those above noted.    In reply he wrote as follows: " I return the message you sent in your letter and I will explain all the blacks here can make of it. The top notches represent the Karagilla class; the bottom ones represent the Kooberoo class and the dots represent a wish to meet."  This statement is important as showing that the notches in the upper and lower edges have a definite meaning as the Kurgilla and Kuburu classes respectively." (Howitt 1889, p. 325)    "Fig. 13. Message stick of the Mundainbura tribe, Queensland, inviting to a corroboree. Upper line of notches represent men of the Kurgila clan, upper line of dots, men of the Kunbe clan, lower line of dots, men of the Wungu clan, and the lower line of notches men of the Kuburu clan. One-fourth scale." (p.332)    "The notches shown on the right-hand edge represent a number of men of the Kurgilla sub-class. The two rows of dots represent men respectively of the Kunbe and Wungu sub-classes. The notches on the left-hand edge represent men of the Kuburu sub-class. The message with it was to invite these people to a corrobboree.  I sent a sketch of the stick to a valued correspondent, Mr. R. Christison of Lammermoor Station, with a request that he would ascertain what the men of the Dalebura tribe, living with him, could make of it.  The Dalebura tribe has the same sub-classes as the Mundainbura tribe. In reply he informed me that his blacks made out the stick to mean, that the right-hand notches represent the Karagilla sub-class ; the left-hand the Kuburu sub-class, and the dots represent a wish to meet.  This statement shows that the notches in the right and  left-hand edges have a definite meaning as the Kurgilla and Kuburu sub-classes respectively."

The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net "yamma" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him. The old man showeed mine to my correspondent with much mystery after sending all the women away from the place    These are all the contributions which I can send you this time but more will follow as soon as I can get them drawn -- I do this because I cannot yet tell whether in the work for which I am gathering materials I may or may not require illustrations of these things. This will not however in any way affect any use to which you may decide to put them. They are yours to do with as you like.

Harald wrote: "Yagalingu falls under the language level entry Wadjigu [wadj1255] wdu. Maybe there should be a dialect level entry Yagalingu -- I am ignorant on  that matter (but at present there isn't)."    Claire wrote: "Yagalingu is probably the same as Belyando in my tree (related to Barna and Biri).  Looks like it should be in East Maric. Again, Harald will have to  say why he chose Biri, Gangulu, and Giya as opposed to other variety names."	 	"The following instance will show how message sticks are used in this tribe, figs. 15 and 16, Plate XIV, represent one which was sent by one of the Wakelbura, to a member of the Yangebura tribe at Blackall. The stick being sent by an Obu is Gidyea [Acacia homalophylla], timber being Wutheru. The message refers to game, (a) being for Emu, (b) for Wallaby, to be found near a certain wire netting fence, (c) on a station near Clermont. The marks on the stick do not convey their meaning without a verbal message. The man who takes the stick explains their meaning. If the stick were sent by a Mallera, everything marked on the stick would be Mallera, and it would be delivered to a Mallera. But the above described and figured stick was sent by Obu to Obu. The sticks are always painted, this one was coloured blue." (Howitt 1889, p. 326)      "Figs. 15 and 16. Message stick from a man of the Wakelbura tribe to a man of the Yangebura tribe, Queensland, inviting him to visit the sender to hunt for game near a certain wire netting fence erected on a sheep run, (a) Emu, (b) Wallaby, (c) the wire netting fence. One-fourth scale." (Howitt 1889, p. 332)    "The message-stick was sent by a Tarrima of the Wakelbura tribe to one of the Yangebura tribe at Blackall. The message referred to game which was to be found in abundance within a wire fence erected near Clermont, and was to invite the Yangebura to come and kill game there." (Howitt 1904, p. 694)     "Einladungen durch Botenstäbe können auch ergehen an andere Lokalgruppen, wenn eine Treibjagd auf Emus oder Wallabys veranstaltet werden soll, Fig. 9. So berichtet es Edge Partington (54, Nr. 8) von den Wakelbura." (Frank, Maria. 1940. “Botenstäbe in Australien.”  p. 335)    Translation: "Invitations with the help of message sticks can also be sent to other local tribes in case of a tribal hunt for emus or wallabies, fig. 9. This is reported by Edge Partington (54, No. 8) about Wakelbura." (tranls.

(2) Message stick sent to me by Mr JF [insert] J.C. [end insert] Muirhead--used by the Wakelbura tribe. All message sticks are painted. This stick was sent by an Oboo of the Wakelbura to one of the Yangebura tribe (at Blackall). The wood is this of Bedyea tree--which belongs to the Wooltheroo class--of which Oboo is a subclass. The message refers to killing game found in a fenced paddock at Mr Wallaces station near Clermont. The game is Emu and Wallaby which are both of the Wooltheroo class and therefore claimed by Oboo and Wongoo. The messenger delivers a verbal message. The marks are according to Mr Muirhead as follows: [2 drawings, the first marked 'Wallaby' and 'Emu' besides the stripes of decoration, the 2nd drawing is annotated 'This indicates the wire fence at Kilcommon Station'] [2] [2] James C. Muirhead. Note that there is correspondence between Muirhead and Howitt at AIATSIS Howitt papers. I can find nothing else about him. Wallace's station refers to Donald Smith Wallace (1844-1900), and his station (Kilcommon?) near Clermont. He represented Clermont in the Queensland Legislative Assembly from 1883-1888. [AP 06/02/2013]    In 1840 Isaac Reckitt rented a starch mill in hull, subsequently purchased in 1848, extending into other household products including washing blue, a bleaching agent. This became the family business Reckitt and Sons, which expanded into the overseas market, opening a business in Australia in 1886. There are examples of Australian Aboriginal material culture that use Reckitt's blue throughout Australia, including rock art at Nourlangie Rock, Kakadu National Park, Northern Territory.

Goodooga, the place it was manufactured, is also within the Muruwari area. The 'Tinanburra tribe' is possible also a division of Muruwari since Tinnenburra station was on the border between Muruwari, Badjiri, Gunu and Baridji.  	 	"When handing the stick to Belay, Imball told him that Nanee and his tribe wished to meet him (Belay) and his tribe on the Cudnappa river for the purpose of holding a corroboree. Imnball further explained to Belay the devices on the stick as follows, which will be better understood by referring to plate VII: Nanee (a) sent the message from the Bokhara river (b), by the hand of Imball (c), via the Birie (d), the Culgoa (e), and Cudnappa (f) rivers, to Belay (g); that the stick was dispatched at new moon (h), and Belay and his tribe are expected to be at Cudnappa river (f) at full moon (i); (j) represents a corroboree ground, and Belay understands from it that Nanee and his tribe are corroboreeing at the Bokhara river, which is their taorai, and, further, that on the meeting of the two tribes at full moon on the Cudnappa river a big corroboree will be held.   The messenger, Imball, is shown standing beside Belay, which conveys the meaning that he will remain with the latter until he and his tribe are ready to start for the place of meeting, and that he, the messenger, will accompany them thither.

This estimate is based on the fact that the message stick was collected in the Gregory River District (which in 1918 encompassed Burktown and areas to the north and southwest). The term "muranda" for message stick might be traced. The closest match in the Chirila database is murrandu=stick in Mithaka (Glottolog: mith1236)	 	Hamlyn-Harris, p.23: "Its message is reputed to be somewhat as follows: -The bearer of the message is sent with another man for two gins (two notches: first notch, single virgin; second notch, widow would suffice), and intimates a big fight which is to take place as a display of dexterity (not tribal fight). Nine wommeras represented by diamonds, and six spears by lines, are sent together with relatives of girls in payment for the two gins. The track indicates the distance to be traversed."    Frank, p.340: "Von einem anderen interessanten Botenstab berichtet Hamlyn-Harris (42, S. 22-23). Derselbe stammt aus dem Gregory-Flußgebiet (nach A. Merton) und führt den eingeborenen Namen ,,Muranda". Er ist auf der ganzen Oberflache mit fein eingeritzten Zeichen bedeckt, die in Mustern angeordnet sind. Der Trager der Botschaft wurde mit einem anderen Mann um zwei Frauen gesandt, die durch zwei Kerben gekennzeichnet wurden. Die erste Kerbe bedeutete eine Jungfrau, die zweite eine Witwe. Die weiteren Zeichen deuten einen großen Scheinkampf an, der stattfinden sollte. Neun Keulen werden durch Rauten, 6 Speere durch gerade Linien dargestellt. Diese Waffen wurden den Verwandten der Frauen als Zahlung (Brautpreis?) angeboten."    Translation: "Hamlyn-Harris (42, S. 22-23) presents another interesting message stick. It was found close to Gregory Rivers (accordign to A. Merton) and is called "Muranda". Its entire surface is covered with symbols that are provided in samples. The bearer of the message stick was sent by a man and regarded two women. The first notch ment a young woman, the secon one ment a widow. The other symbols represented a battle that was going to take palce. Nine cubs were rendered with the help of rhombs, six spears were represented as straight lines. These weapons were offered to the relatives of the women as a fee (ransom?)." (transl.

It is nevertheless [29] an acknowledged fact that the native can generally tell whether a stick belongs to "his country" or not, and is, I fancy, an indication that there was a time, probably not so very remote, when there was a greater persistency of type in definite districts."

Mother first time, die. Bye-bye me tell 'em. Toby  alonga me"  Hamlyn-Harris's interpretation: "My brother-in-law, I want you to leave home in three months. I would like you to come and see me here. A white man stole me from home and shot my brother in a xxx. Tell old Samson I'm here. Where is Charlie? If you see him tell him to come too. Your mother and old granny have both died. Cannot tell you more now. Toby is with me." (Hamlyn-Harris 1918, p. 29)    "Wenn ich nun versuche die einzelnen Zeichen selbst zu erklaren, so muß ich schon zugeben, daß mir dies nicht ganz möglich ist.Wenn wir mit dem “Lesen” von links beginnen, so könnten die drei Winkel die drei Monate bedeuten. Die darauf folgende Wellenlinieden Wunsch, den Empfanger zu sehen; der Pfeil würde dann die sehießenden und raubenden Weißen bedeuten, die den Bruder im Boot er schossen haben. Die Übrigen Berichte und Bitten sind mir nach den Zeichen nicht verständlich. Vielleicht waren auf der Rückseite noch Zeichen, welche die Einladungen und den Bericht von dem Tod der Mutter ausdrückten." (Frank 1940, p.340)  Translation JB (Frank 1940, p.340): "If I try to explain the individual signs myself, I may admit that this is not entirely possible. If we start with "reading" from the left, the three angles could mean the three months. The following wave lines mean a wish to see the receiver; the arrow would then mean the whites who shot the brother in the boat. The signs of other reports and requests are not understandable to me. Perhaps there were still signs on the back that expressed the invitations and the report of the mother's death."	 	 	sd_time_moon  sd_death  sd_violence  sd_person_mother  sd_person_grandmother	114	13	 	Pine wood	 	Hamlyn Harris, R. 1918. “On messages and ‘message sticks’ employed among the Queensland Aborigines.”  Memoirs of the Queensland Museum 6:13-36.

Hamlyn-Harris:  "This stick was obtained by Bishop White (when Bishop of Carpentaria) on the Daly waters, and donated by him to the Queensland Museum. its interest lies in the fact that, just as the Bishop was leaving Darwin by coach, an aboriginal boy brought this stick to the diver and ask him to deliver it to another blackboy at Daly waters with this message:"Want 'em pretty fellow alonga head, boomerang." Bishop White was so interested in the matter that he undertook to deliver the stick, but withheld the verbal message until he had satisfied himself that the receiver of the message had some knowledge of what the stick was [30] supposed to convey. Bishop White said he was no little surprised to find that the boy interpreted the request for head-bands and boomerangs correctly.  Since the accuracy of this instance is vouched for by the integrity of such a well-known cleric, we may also presume that the stick probably contained some mention of an exchange and the name of the boy by whom it had been sent.

Als dieser einst Darwin verließ, brachte ein eingeborener Knabe diesen Stock und bat einen Kutscher denselben einem anderen Knaben am Daly water zu überbringen. Bischof White interessieite sich sehr fur die Sache und ubernahm den Stock selbst. Bei der Übergabe wußte der Knabe genau, was sein Freund von ihm verlange. Die Botschaft lautete im Pitehen-Englisch: "Want'em pretty fellow alonga head, boomerang." Er wünsehte somit Kopfbänder und Bumerangs. Bumerangs werden in Westaustralien öfter durch schiefe Kreuze dargestellt, wie sie auch auf dem in Frage stehenden Stab an gegeben sind. Es würde sich hier um 17 Bumerangs handeln, da die Zahl der Kreuze auf beiden Seiten 17 ist. Außer den Kreuzzeichen sind nur noch drei verschieden lange gerade Striche vorhanden, die vielleicht die Kopf bänder bedeuten können".  Translation JB: "The message stick (Fig.24) is of particular interest because it has been reviewed by Bishop White of Carpentaria for accuracy (42, S.30). When he was leaving Darwin, a native boy brought this message stick and asked a coachman to deliver it to another boy at Daly water. Bishop White took much interest in the matter and took over the matter himself. When Bishop White handed the stick over to the boy at Daly water, he knew exactly what his friend wanted of him. The message was in Pitehen English: "Want'em pretty fellow alonga head, boomerang." He wanted headbands and boomerangs. Boomerangs in Western Australia are more often represented by oblique crosses, as the ones in the message stick in question. There would be 17 boomerangs here, as the number of crosses is 17 on both sides.

The "Ooldea tribe" is analysed as Mirniny. (Note, however, that Mirniny turns up twice in Chirila. One is over on the western edge of the Nullabor near Caiguna. The other is further east near Eucla. The Eucla Mirniny is the one referred to here.)  We have assumed that "Ooldea tribe" is (eastern) Mirniny on the basis of the fact that the Ooldea soak is in this area at 30°24'29.0"S 131°49'42.0"E and the mission settlement is here: 30° 27′ 32.9″ S, 131° 50′ 8.21″ E.

The same object was reproduced imaginatively by Amelie Frank in a sketch based Dawson's description (presumably she did not have access to the Bastian sketch). Her sketch can be found on p. 345 of "Botenstäbe in Australien"    	Sender: "King Davie" (Bastian, p. 193)  Sender: "Kaawirn Kuunawarn, the chief of the Kirræ Wuurong tribe" (Dawson, p.73)	1881	terminus ante quem	 	Image of a message stick (artefact missing)	traditional	VIC	Chirila: Giraiwurung  Austlang: S25: Keerray Woorroong / Kirrae Whurrong  Glottolog: warr1257  	Chirila: Wathawurrung  Austlang: S29: Wathawurrung / Wadawurrung / Wathaurong  Glottolog: wath1238	 	The message stick is associated with Hopkins River.    The linguistic area is inferred from Kirræ Wuurong which Claire Bowern renders as Giraiwurung, and Barry Blake as Kiriwurrung, but is probably identical to the Warnambool language (there is no glottolog code for Giraiwurung).    Wathawurrung is inferred from the birthplace of Kaawirn Kuunawarn at Lake Connewarren in Victoria. 	 	Dawson (1881):    "The spear-thrower is also used as a message-stick ; but, when so employed, it is specially marked to indicate its purpose. The writer has in his possession a specimen which was made by Kaawirn Kuunawarn, the chief of the Kirræ Wuurong tribe, and which is a facsimile of a summons issued by him long ago to three tribes, to meet his own tribe at a favourite swamp and camping-place called Kuunawarn, on the east side of the River Hopkins, and represents their approach to his camp. In the centre of the flat side of the spear-thrower is a carved circle of about an inch and a quarter in diameter, which represents the camp of Kaawirn Kuunawarn. Near it are three notches on the edge of the stick, and two lines and two dots on the flat side, pointing to the camp, which form his signature ; and, at the hooked end of the stick, three lines in shape of the letter Z indicate his presence. Four rows of notches, extending from each end of the stick to the camp, indicate the numbers of individuals of the two tribes approaching from opposite directions. On the other side of the spear-thrower, in the centre, there are two circles of a smaller size, and pointing to them is a small, rudely carved figure of a hand—the word for ‘hand,’ munya, also means a ‘ meeting.’ From each end of the stick six lines of notches represent the numbers of individuals of other two tribes approaching from opposite directions. As each notch indicates an individual, there must have been a thousand at this meeting. Kaawirn Kuunawarn was then a very young chief ; and as he is now a man considerably over sixty years of age, the meeting must have been held immediately previous to the occupation of the country by the white man. Of those who attended it there are only four individuals now alive, viz., Kaawirn Kuunawarn, Jamie Ware, Jim Crow, and Helen Crow." (p73)    Adolf Bastian: "Die Zeichnung ist ein Facsimile eines Originals, durch Ihren [Hr. J. Dawsons] alten Freund King Davie gebracht, um drei Stämme, unter seinen Befehl, nach seinem Lager (Kuunaru am Hopkins) zu rufen. Der Kreis auf der flachen Seite zeigt dies Lager, und die Reihen von Einkerbungen bedeuten die auf jeder Seite herannahenden Männer. Die andere Seite ähnlich. Die Figur der Hand bedeutet eine Zusammenkunft, und die Zickzack Linien am einen Ende die Gegenwart des Häuptlings." (p. 193)    Translation: "The drawing is a reproduction of an original, brought by his [Mr. J. Dawson's] old friend King Davie in order to invite three clans he to his camp (Kuunaru on Hopkins). A circle on the flat side represents this camp, and the rows of notches stand for the men coming from each side. This applies to the other sides of the stick as well. The silhouette of the hand represents the gathering and the zigzag lines at one end signal the attendance of the head." (Transl. Olena Tykhostup)     Frank writes: "So ist folgender Botenstab in drei Stammen in Gebrauch. Dawson übersetzt die Zeichen wie folgt: "... auf einer Seite sind Einschnitte, welche die Zahl der Stämme bezeichnen, die man erwartet, auf der anderen die Zahl der Männer, die er (der Sender) fordert" ... "Ein Speerwerfer als Botenstab von drei Stammen verstanden. Ein Häuptling zeigt seine Ankunft auf dem von seinem Stamm bevorzugten Sumpf und Versammlungsplatz, genannt Kuunawaru an der Ostküste des Hopkin-Flusses, an.   a) Das Feld von Kaawiru Kuunawaru.   b) Zeichen fur ein Lager.   c) Anwesenheit des Hauptlings an den angegebenen Platz.   d) Zahl der Individuen der beiden Stamme von entgegengesetzter Richtung kommend.   e) Zahl der Leute der zwei anderen Stamme. Es mussen an Tausend sich versammelt haben" (26, S. 72) (Fig. 28)." (p. 342)    Translation: "The following stick is used in three tribes. Dawson translates the symbols as follows: "[...] on the one side there are the notches that represent the number of tribes, that are expected. On the other side there is the amount of men that he (the sender) asks for." [...] "The stick is recognized by three tribes. The chief announced his arrival to the swamps that belonged to his tribe, and to the gathering area called Kuunawaru on the East coast of the Hopkin River.   a) The field of Kaawiru Kuunawaru.  b) The drawing of the camp.  c) The presence of the chief in the mentioned area.  d) Number of people from both tribes coming from the opposite directions.  e) Number of people from two other tribes.

It lexifies 'hand' and 'great meeting, native village'.

PK wrote to the Camperdown Heritage Centre on 12 May 2019: "I'm trying to establish the location of an important spearthrower collected by James Dawson some time prior to 1881. I have a feeling it is in your collection since James Dawson founded the Camperdown Museum in the late 19th century.  The spearthrower has an oval carved on its widest part and towards the centre there is an image of a tiny hand. Note that it may not be immediately identifiable as a spearthrower because it was repurposed as a message stick! If the spearthrower is in your collection I would love to have: 1. digital photographs of it , 2. photographs of any accompanying documentation or labels, 3. photographs of any other message sticks that James Dawson may have collected.  Evidence for the existence of the message stick, as described by James Dawson, can be viewed here on page 73 of 'Australian Aborigines': https://archive.org/stream/australianaborig81daws#page/n88/mode/1up  ... where there is a full description.    There is also a sketch of the message stick apparently by James Dawson but published by the German anthropologist Adolf Bastian in 1881.

James Dawson's natural history collection was displayed in a room at the Shire of Hampden offices after being built in 1885/86 until the Mechanics Institute was rebuilt in 1890. The collection was then housed in the "Museum Room" on the second floor. Dawson had requested a second floor be built to ensure his collection would not be kept in damp rooms. His will and probate papers show that he left his natural history  and native weapons collections to the Mechanics Institute Museum, all of which had been housed there for the past 7 years on his death in 1900.    Unfortunately the collection was broken up with a section transferred to the State School in 1936 and other items to the Higher Elementary School at some stage. The latter school was destroyed by fire in 1940 and the State School in 1965. All records etc were lost in both fires, and also the museum collections.    The Camperdown Historical Society was formed in 1960, firstly with no premises. A small ground floor room at the Mechanics Institute was then provided, with little display room. In 1984 the Town of Camperdown council provided our current premises which allow for a good amount of display space.  We have a small collection of aboriginal artefacts which mostly came from the collection of Dr Hope who looked after the Aboriginals at Buntingdale Mission near Birregurra. He was apparently given items in payment for his services. These were housed for some years at Chocolyn School (near Camperdown) until it closed. They were then stored by a local resident before gifting them to our Society.    We have double checked the items we have but unfortunately none resemble the description of the item you requested.    As you have deposited funds into our account but we are unable to help would you like photos of some of the items we do hold?  If you would like a refund please provide your bank account details.    One of our members and a regular volunteer is a GG Grand-daughter of James Dawson and custodian of family information but knows no more than I have written.    Sorry we could not be of more help.

[JC 20 9 2000]    Research notes: This is possibly one of the object mentioned in a letter from Howitt [Howitt 10] of the Tylor papers PRM ms collections Box 12 of June 25 1883:     'Dear Dr Tylor Your letter of the 13th May reminds me that I have not yet sent the turndun which I promised in my last letter. The reason is that I have been waiting until I could get them carefully drawn in order that I may have their versimilitudes for reference. I shall now send the following within the next two days in one or parcels [sic] as I find they may require for travel purposes    (1) Murring Mudthi (bullroarer) used at Mileatom [?] and found [illegible] factory. [insert] The notch at the end represents the gap where the tooth has been knocked out [end insert]    (2) Dieri -- Yuntha (Bullroarer) This was used at the Dieri ceremonies and also by me at those of the Coast Murring    (3) Chepara Message stick I am not able to get an explanation of the marks. It seems probable that the existing blackfellows of the Chepara tribe (on the coast south of Brisbane) have forgotten the meaning. Mr Gibson to whom I am indebted for this stick tells me that his informant states that his father used to make these sticks but that he only knew of the meaning of the marks.    (4) Dieri message token of Emu feathers. The messenger carries this and delivers the message by word of mouth    (5) Narrinyeri message stick No explanation can be given of the marks. Narringyeri tribe is at the Murray River mouth    (6) Woi-worung message stick. the marks are said not to have had any meaning beyond being connected in the messengers mind with his message. Woi-worung was the name of the tribe living above Melbourne.    (7) Message stick used on the Diamantina River [insert] Queensland [end insert] So far as I can learn the marks are the enumeration of men who are invited to attend the details being given by the messenger.    (8) Gournd[insert] i [end insert]tch mara message stick. I am told that this stick was sent with the messenger who conveyed the message by word of mouth    (9) Dieri net. This net "yamma" was delivered to the Pinya (armed party) when any person was doomed to death by the Great Council of the Dieri tribe and the offender having been killed, this net was laid upon him as a sign to all concerned. Let me mention here that this Great Council was composed to the principal men of the Dieri tribe. The Heads of Murdus (Totems) Warriors, Orators, Wizards and held its meetings in secret. This great Council was supreme and different from the General Council which consisted of all the initiated men of the tribe.     10. Aaja-dura - Bullroarer. I cannot at present turn up the letter in which my correspondents gave me the name of this example. It was sent to me by the Headman of this tribe which inhabits Yorks Peninsula S.A. in return for a bullroarer which I sent to him. The old man showeed mine to my correspondent with much mystery after sending all the women away from the place    These are all the contributions which I can send you this time but more will follow as soon as I can get them drawn -- I do this because I cannot yet tell whether in the work for which I am gathering materials I may or may not require illustrations of these things. This will not however in any way affect any use to which you may decide to put them. They are yours to do with as you like. If there are any other blackfellows implements which you want I shall be delighted to try and obtain them for you.

UNAIPON1925P11  	A sketch of a message stick provided by David Unaipon in a 1925 article in The Register	interpreted_artefact  glossed_artefact  500_29618  long_distance	Sketch of message stick in 1925 article "Aboriginal Marching Orders. A Message Stick Interpreted" from "The Register" newspaper.    "Considerable interest has been aroused in Adelaide over the ability of David Unaipon, a full-blooded aboriginal, to explain in scientific terms the folklore of his people. An interview with Unaipon appeared in. The Register of 1 October 3. By way of expressing his appreciation, Mr. Unaipon presented to The Register the translation of a message stick, made for him by the native doctor who was to accompany him on his northern trip as interpreter.  This is the first time that a message stick has ever been translated for the white man's understanding. The message in question, of which a diagram is shown, contains; a war order from Warta Yunna, chief of all the surrounding minor chiefs. As the key indicated it gives all the surrounding tribes their marching orders, directing the routes by which they are to gather together at one central spot and prepare for battle. The angles show the points at which they are to. make smoke signals."  	Sender: "a native doctor"  Recipient: "Mr. Unaipon"	1925	terminus ante quem	 	Image of a message stick (artefact missing)	traditional	SA_unlocalisable	 	 	 	This is most likely in South Australia, since it was given to David Unaipon who provided the interpretation. It was made for him by "the native doctor who was to accompany [Unaipon] on his northern trip as interpreter".     There are at least three avenues of inquiry:    1) It would be worth finding out about Unaipon's northern trip, presumably this means north in relation to Adelaide where The Register was published. If the identity of the interpreter could be discovered this would help isolate the linguistic area associated with the message stick (Unaipon's own affiliation is Ngarrindjeri). The preceding article in the Register is here: http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64244883    PK contacted Tim Rowse on 27 August 2019, who suggested contacting Philip Jones.    Other ways to narrow the search would be to find these names of people "Warta Yunna", "Thumgara", "Kow Wona", "Mulgarra", "Quenra", "Mindala", "Bungala", "Matharoo", "Oora", "Kow Dull", "War Tura".     2) Identify the language used in the interpretation.  Special clues for the language are   thumgara=dew  kow wona= thunder cloud  oora = wild grass bark  kow dull= wild potato  wommena= boomerangs    In Chirila lexical dataset:  dew = cannot find equivalent to thumgara  thunder = koːɹanna or koːɹunna in Parnkala, koːɹoːna in Wirangu, koːnoː in Yalarrnga (too far away)  wild potato = cannot find equivalent to kow dull    wongela= boomerang on Barcoo river (Queensland or SA?)  wungela = boomerang in Yambina (too far away)  waŋala = boomerang in Yuwi  wunggela = boomerang in Blackall-Barcoo River (probably QLD)  woomera= boomerang according to 'Aboriginal Names of Places with their Meanings, etc' (this could just be a mistake since woomera is Eora word for spear-thrower, after which the place derives its name)    According to Curr boomerang is panketyi in Ngarrindjeri.    So far the best lead is Parnkala and the adjacent Wirungu language. However in the Barngala dictionary based on Clamor Wilhelm Schurmann returns:  dew = yarlda; boorgoo  thunder = goorrana  cloud=mabinya; malgoo; baloowara  boomerang = wadna [used in Port Lincoln only for killing fish]    3) Continuing from the above, of the 13 individuals mentioned in the interpretation, four have names that are glossed as nouns. This suggests that these might be totem names:  Thumgara (Dew)  Kow Wona (Thunder Cloud)   Chief Oora (wild grass bark)  Kow Dull (wild potato)    On this line of inquiry it might be worth looking at AustKin for totem systems north of Adelaide that include these names.     The name Matharoo could be a moiety name, per Arabana moiety matthurie (the other moiety is kirawara)	 	"The message in question, of which diagram is shown, contains a war order from Warta Yunna, chief of all the surrounding minor chiefs. As the key indicated it gives all the surrounding tribes their marching orders, directing the routes by which they are to gather together at one central spot and prepare for battle.

A central hole is incised on each side.    NMA description: A drawing of both sides of 1985.0059.0398 includes explanation of its symbols. This explanation is reproduced here in full and the numbers refer to the different sides of this object:    "1. The Mulga and the Lachlan tribes are to meet at a given point to perform the sacred Bora ceremony. The Lachlan tribe having the longest distance to travel have 3 months (or moons) notice. The Mulga tribe is allowed 1 month and 1 week. Closer in clans have a corresponding lesser time.    2. These marks convey the details of the ceremony proposed. The particulars are known only to the Karadja "Wise Men" of the tribes."    Edmund Milne (1861-1917) was born in England and emigrated to Queensland with his parents 19 months later. He had had personal contact with Aboriginal people throughout his life, from when he was a small boy in Queensland and, from the late 1860s, in New South Wales. This contact may have led him to recording the names of Aboriginal people associated with particular objects in his collection, at a time when this was rarely done. Milne seems to have begun actively collecting Indigenous artefacts in the early 1880s and was still acquiring objects a few months before his death in 1917. His work with the NSW Railways (1876-1917) enabled him to meet a broad range of people who facilitated his collecting and associated activities like visiting Aboriginal sites. From at least the time he lived at Orange NSW (1906-1915), and later at Ryde (1915-1917), near to Sydney city, he displayed his collection at his home. In addition to a large collection of Aboriginal artefacts, Milne's collection included artefacts from the South Pacific and prehistoric implements from Egypt, France and England. In his will dated 12 December 1916, Milne bequeathed his 'Anthropological collection' to the 'first Federal Museum opened in the Federal Capital'. The collection remained at Ryde until early 1931 when it was acquired by the Australian Institute of Anatomy in Canberra. It remained there until the Institute's collections were transferred to the National Museum of Australia in 1985.

Elsewhere, Edmund Milne associates the Mulga tribe with Coronga Peak (see NMA object 1985.0059.0051), Yallock (see 1985.0059.0289), Cobar (see 1985.0059.0100) and Byrock (1985.0059.0333). On this basis the best approximation would be Ngiyambaa for the Mulga tribe.     Using John Oxley's journal of 1820, Milne sought out the desecrated burial site of a Lachlan 'chief' at 33°04'08.7"S 146°47'20.5"E, a site termed 'King's Grave' by the NSW Office of Environment & Heritage. Accordingly, 'Lachlan' most likely refers to Wiradjuri.	 	 	 	 	 	85	20	 	Wood	 	 	Museum collection	 	The National Museum of Australia	1985.0059.0398	Edmund Milne collection  Date acquired by donor (Australian Institute of Anatomy) 1931	 	 	National Museum of Australia	30°44'09.3"S	146°19'39.8"E	For Ngiyambaa, the default Google coordinates for Mulga creek are 30°44'09.3"S 146°19'39.8"E,  these happen lie between Byrock and Cobar.

NMA1985_0209_0001	A message stick from Queensland in the National Museum of Australia	localized_artefact  NMA-1985.0209.0001	Cylindrical, wooden shafted message stick with a pointed lower end and a tuft of emu feathers bound to the truncated end with fibre string, pigmented overall in geometric designs and dots on a white background.        The Dick and Lindsay Roughsey Collection comprises a cylindrical, wooden, message stick with a pointed lower end and a tuft of emu feathers bound with red fibre string. The surface of the message stick, painted by Mornington Island artists and brothers Dick and Lindsay Roughsey, is covered with goodwill symbols painted in black, yellow, red and white in geometric designs and lines, dots and dashes on a white background. It was presented to prominent scholar of Aboriginal studies, Dr F. D. McCarthy, in Canberra in 1972.    Although not universal throughout Aboriginal Australia, message sticks were used by many tribes, including Lardil people, for various reasons including the coordination of large socio-economic events, to summon others for initiation ceremonies, for hostile purposes or to convey messages relating to sickness or death. Traditional message or 'talking' sticks were made of soft wood, ornamented, carved and often painted bright colours, and marked in various ways with notches, dots, strokes, curves and geometric designs. Lardil artists and brothers, Dick (Goobalathaldin) and Lindsay (Burud), Roughsey, were prominent in reviving and preserving the art culture of the Lardil people which has a long history stemming from traditions of body painting and shows strong affinities to ceremonial designs stretching to Central Australia. Beginning with bark painting, inspired by his visits to Arnhem Land in the 1950s, Dick Roughsey, OBE, went on to become internationally renowned for his children's books and remains one of Australia?s most significant artists. His talented older brother Lindsay, also known as 'Spider', was a source of inspiration to younger artists and at the heart of the history of Lardil painting from the early 1960s until his death in 2007.

From Guan Lim: "Part 1 and 2 of this story shows Galitju making message sticks. Galitju, Yirrirnirnba and Mirarra' provide commentary on how old people used these message sticks before telecommunications, paper, and air travel found their way to Arnhem Land.      A bit about Galitju... as well as making an appearance in the feature film Yolngu Boy, Andrew Galitju is known throughout Arnhem Land and the 'Top End' of the Northern Territory as a legendary hunter, cross-cultural educator, and all-round nice guy.    When I first met Galitju some 10 years ago, it was with Yolngu friends who paid him a visit in order to purchase turtle meat from his deep freezer. There is always a ready supply of magpie goose, stingray, fish, turtle and other culinary delights in Galitju's house!    Galitju is my "brother-in-law", father to yirdaki extraordinaire 'DJ' Burarrwanga, second father to George Rr*rr*mb*, and grandfather to Henry Mirarra' Burarrwanga."

The piece was collected around Lajamanu so it is safe to assume the language is Warlpiri   The stick was carried aboriginal's when they travelled and it's function was to let Aboriginal's know that they meant no harm and it was carried as a sign of good faith when travelling amongst other people's land.

 	A message stick listed for sale	interesting	This message stick was chosen for the front page of the Australian Message Stick Database for an unusual reason: we know almost nothing about it.    Message sticks are found in museums and archives but they also circulate among private sellers and collectors. Sadly, the histories of these objects are often not recorded or poorly maintained. Auction houses, for example, will not even reveal the names of their owners or previous owners for privacy reasons so stories and connections are quickly lost.     The AMSD is keeping track of message sticks that are sold and resold in order to trace their movements. We also hope that by posting the images from these sales, interested members of the public might recognise the objects and help us contextualise them.     This message stick was apparently collected in the Northern Territory in the 1950s. If you own it, or have previously owned it, please get in contact.

At the time he donated them to the British Museum, he described them as ‘Weapons of the Dalleburra tribe whose chief camping ground was round the waterhole Narkool on Lower Tower Hill Creek, which is the main source of the Thomson River, Queensland, Latitude 20o S longitude 144o E’ (Ethdoc 903)."    Curator's comments: "Message stick of the Dalleburra tribe, Narkool, (the name of their general camping ground round a waterhole of the same name on Lower Hill Creek, which is the main source of the Thomson River, Queensland, Latitude 20o S longitude 144o E) Mitchell District, North Queensland."    BM: "Made by Yirandali (aka Dalleburra)"    PK: Note that Yirandali and Dalleburra and in very different parts of Queensland, according to Austlang which lists Dalleburra as a synonym for Yirandali but not vice versa. Chirila does not list Dalleburra (Dalla) at all. Towerhill creek is in Yirandali country so I suspect this is the correct area.    Ideally, the coordinates should be dropped at Narkool, or failing that, Lammermoor Station.    In "Aboriginal Cultural Water Values – Galilee subregion  A report for the Bioregional Assessment Programme", Narkool is listed as a waterhole on Yirendali country and described with "Central Camp site/Ceremonial Site/Burial site/Scar Tree" and " a main camp waterhole, ‘Lammermoor’ belonging to King Narkool aka  King Barney", and "Narkool is a main camp waterhole, Lammermoor, belong to King Narkool aka King Barney."  Christoson's coordinates (Latitude 20o S longitude 144o E) are well north of Yirandali country but it could be that he is referring to the source of the Thomson river.    I have been unable to find coordinates for either Narkool or Lammermoor Station (which may no longer exist or its name may have changed). I have given coordinates for  Towerhill Creek.

On one side is a carving of a canoe in the water, & having a rough passage; on the other side is a drawing of tobacco & tucker. The meaning of the message is “We have just come from Melville island. The canoe is no good, it rocks too much. We have all been seasick. Send tucker & tobacco to Shoal Bay, our bellies are empty.”    The reason for the stick being shaped like a cone is to show that the sender had travelled in a canoe from the Island. The wavy lines in the canoe represent the sea-sick passengers; “Him belly jump about all same kangaroo”, explained the dusky gentleman who gave me the stick.    The marks are made by fire, & also by a sharp-pointed instrument, but the boy could not say whether it was a spear-point, a knife, or a piece of broken glass. I incline to the idea that it [is] made by the point of a spear. The straight lines represent tobacco; the other lines mean food; (tucker); “Might be damper, might be bread, might be bullock (beef), might be tea, sugar, him all about plenty hungry-fellow; canoe bin too much jump-about, him sick all same dog”.    The tiny scrap of string has no significance; it was merely used to fasten the stick to the boy’s waist-belt so that it should not be lost.

Broome illustrate the message sticks donated, and include a note made in pencil: 'message sticks (or rather newspapers)'. A description of what could be depicted on this message stick appears in a book written by Broome's wife, Lady Broome, 'Remembered with Affection. A new edition of Lady Broome's "Letters to Guy" with notes and a short life by Alexandra Hasluck', Oxford University Press, Melbourne, 1963, p. 115-6:    Perhaps the "message sticks" are the most curious, with their smooth surface of which all the news of the place is neatly and carefully drawn. It looks like etching, and is done with a finely painted red-hot stick; it really is the newspaper of the district. You see the long strip of land, with its post and rail fence, or two or three rude houses which constitute the nucleus of what is going to be a great city, perhaps; or else there is an ummistakable bit of a harbour, and the fleet of pearlers is just coming in, with every sail set and a fair wind.There are some trees just indicated, men stand by an open grave, horses are picketed behind, and there is a rude cross in the corner, where a little clearing has been made to mark a former explorer's grave'.	 	 	 	254	23	5	Wood	Incised	 	Museum collection	Acquisition date: 1885	The British Museum	Oc,+.2424	Donated by: Sir Frederick Napier Broome	 	 	British Museum Creative Commons (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0)	 	 	 	http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=509598&partId=1&searchText=message+stick&images=true&page=1	 	 	EOC5869	Additional IDs: Oc1885C2.2424-2425 (old CDMS no.)

Normally I would have had quite a few bids on the piece by now, but only have 2 watchers.  I think that with the beginning of the new year, less spending money and a lack of serious bidders out there, the best option would be for me to try listing this stick again at some other time     To answer your questions,   I cannot see any protruberance on either of the stick ends that would suggest any form of catapult ( woomera ), nor any resin traces that would have suggested some type of breech for a spear mount.    I was told at the time I bought several artifacts from the collection, that the original owner was elderly and retired.  He went back to his former homeland in Europe. The surname was pronounced Clews, Clews, Cloose...not sure about the spelling as the name was verbally stated.  These items were acquired at a dispersal sale through third parties, so I could not gather any more concrete information.    Sorry I could not have been more help.  regards, Roni."

PK: For Lyon's river the suspects are, the following, with location info taken from Austlang:    Malgaru ("East of Kennedy Range and in the hills east of Lyons River from Gascoyne Junction north to near Minnie Creek; at Eudamullah; south to near Fossil Hill (Tindale 1974)"    Watjarri ("the country originally inhabited by the Wajarri appears to have extended from between the Wooramel and Gascoyne Rivers south to between the Murchison River and the Geraldton-Mt. Magnet road; in the west it approached the coastal highway and in the east it extended to around Mileura Station (Marmion 1996:2). North to the hills overlooking the head of the Lyons River, Teano Range, Mount Isabella, Waldburg Range; on upper Gascoyne River west of Three Rivers; at Erivilla and Milgun; south to Cheangwa and the Roderick and upper Sanford rivers (Tindale 1974). ... along the upper reaches of the Murchison river, from around Yallalong Station in the west, to near Meekatharra in the east, from north of Mt Augustus, to south of Talarang Peak (sic, gazetted as Tallering Peak) (Mackman 2011:231). ")      Yingkarta: ("Dench (1979) and O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966) say the language has a northern and southern dialect. Austin names the dialects as Manthi and Thirrily. Tindale locates Mandi (Manthi) at Carnarvon, on the lower Gascoyne River from Doorawarrah to the sea, south to near Grey Point, north only to the southern part of Boolathanna. Tindale locates Tedei (Thirrily) at the eastern coast of Shark Bay and valley of the Wooramal River from the coast north of Yarringa, north only to Pimbie, Carey Downs, and the south of Towrana (WA Handbook). the Yingkarta (Inggarda) territory is far too large and extends east of where it should be - the limit was Gascoyne Junction and the Lyons River (Austin in Sutton 1995:97). The territory occupied by the Yingakarta people extended from the coast at the northern end of Shark Bay between the Gascoyne and Wooramel rivers, along the rivers inland to Red Hill and Gascoyne Junction (Dench 1998:5).")    Warriyangga: ("Upper Lyons River, also Gifford and Minnie creeks; on Minnie Creek Station, at Edmund and the eastern side of Maroonah (Tindale 1974). Malgaru: East of Kennedy Range and in the hills east of Lyons River from Gascoyne Junction north to near Minnie Creek; at Eudamullah; south to near Fossil Hill (Tindale 1974). Warriyangka country was from Edmund south along the Lyons River, not nearly as far north as Davis (1993) indicates (Austin in Sutton 1995:97).")

Not sure if Mirniny is really a language that has vowel-initial words either, so the realisation could be something like yalityi or waliti.	Olena Tykhostup  Piers Kelly	00-No_image_available.png	
SAM_A_27229	A message stick from South Australia held in the South Australian Museum	samuseum  localized_artefact	Message stick from the South Australian Museum	 	1939	terminus ante quem	 	Message stick in a collection	 	 	Chirila: Mirniny  Austlang: A9: Mirning  Glottolog: no code  	 	 	The origin of the message stick is North of Ooldea, South Australia.    Language is uncertain and inferred from geography. Could also be Wirangu or any number of languages that met at the Ooldea Mission station    The "Ooldea tribe" is nonetheless analysed as Mirniny. (Note, however, that Mirniny turns up twice in Chirila. One is over on the western edge of the Nullabor near Caiguna. The other is further east near Eucla. The Eucla Mirniny is the one referred to here.)  We have assumed that "Ooldea tribe" is (eastern) Mirniny on the basis of the fact that the Ooldea the mission settlement is in this area at 30° 27′ 32.9″ S, 131° 50′ 8.21″ E and Ooldea soak is just north of it at 30°24'29.0"S 131°49'42.0"E.  Tindale also refers to "Miming man of Ooldea who went to Esperance by train and found friendly southern people there". Note that the Ooldea settlement was used as a base for constructing the railroad.     Harald wrote: "For doculects that that referred to as Mirning or the like the  corresponding Glottolog variety can be either        Kalarko [kala1379] kba      Ngadjunmaya [ngad1258] nju    It's debatable whether there should be a separate variety with that name.  Mirning is also the name of a subgroup"    Claire wrote: "So it looks like Glottolog includes 2 western Mirning languages but not the eastern-most one around Eucla, since the term Ngatjumaya is specifically  for Western Mirning? I see in my tree I used "Mirniny", "Ngatjumaya" and  "Eucla", and a number of Noongar varieties; I didn't have data for inland  varieties."

They arrived at Kaparlgoo on 25 November 1899, in the country of the Gonbudj, and close to that of the Ngaduk, Gaagudju, Umbugarla 19  and Limilngan people." (Fraser 2008, 19)    In his talk on 26 June for NTAS Bill Lennox said: "When I think and write about Kapalga, I am usually referencing Kapalga billabong and the land immediately around it. Kapalga billabong is one kilometre west of the South Alligator River, about 10 km in a straight line from the Arnhem Highway bridge." Following this leads to a track called Kapalga Access which leads to a billabong.

YN1996	Euthanasia message stick	parliament  interpreted_artefact  glossed_artefact  political  500_33408  localized_artefact  arnhem_land	Accompanying text reads: "This letter stick – ḏarpa dhāwumirri – is sent because it follows the ancient practice of our people – Yolŋu – when communicating with trading partners, in diplomatic alliances, or between Parliaments. This message is a special form of communication between the Parliaments of the Yolŋu Nation/States within East Arnhem Land, and the Commonwealth Parliament of Australia.   It contains within its markings, a reference to Māgaya, which is the responsibility of the Parliament to the citizens. Māgaya is the peace, order and good government afforded the people constitutionally under Customary Law in a manner similar to the Australian Constitution as stated in section 5l.  The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act of the Northern Territory is seen as breaking these fundamental constitutional responsibilities placed upon the Parliament. Further, Yolŋu Customary Law – "Common Law" – defines the enactment of the Northern Territory Act as an illegal action of sorcery punishable at law.  For this reason this message endorses the action of Kevin Andrews MP to bring a Private Member's bill which will overturn the NT Act. Indeed, it is the sacred responsibility of this Parliament to do this.  This message urges the members of both houses to support the Bill's passage into legislation.

Bastian writes: "Rein zufällig war jedenfalls die Beobachtung, soweit sie mich angeht. Durch einen Zufall gewissermaassen gelangte ich nach Cooktown, durch einen Zufall wurde ich einige Tage dort aufgehalten, und durch einen Zufall wieder kam ich mit einem der dortigen Bewohner in ein Gespräch, in dessen Laufe ich durch eine zufällige Neben-[240]-bemerkung aufmerksam wurde und zum Weiterfragen veranlasste. Zuesrt hörte ich in Gesellschaft mit Hrn. St. Georges, dem Police-Magistrate, und einem alten Colonisten, dem Australien seine zweite Heimath geworden war, von dem ausgedehnten System von Signale sprechen, wodurch sich die australischen Stämme (besonders am Dawson) auf weite Entfernung hin verständlich zu machen wüssten, von den in Bäumen eingeschnitzten Zeichen (ähnlich den in Höhlen angetroffenen  Malereien), von Verzierungsformen u. dergl., und dann wurden auch einander zugeschickte Briefe erwähnt. Ich hielt dies mehr für eine Facon de parler und konnte an demselben Abend, wo ich von einer Erkundigung auf die andere geführt wurde, nicht wieder darauf zurückkommen. Am nächsten Morgen traf ich mit einem Sergeanten der sog. Black Police (gleich den meisten Offizieren dieses trefflich organisierten Corps über die Eingebornen wohlunterrichtet) zusammen, und als ich das Gespräch auf denselben Gegenstand brachte, erhielt ich zu meiner Verwunderung  nicht die halb und halb erwartete Widerlegung, sondern eine Bestätigung. Genauere Erklärungen, auf welche ich jetzt einzugehen suchte, konnte mein Gewährsmann mir leider nicht geben, versprach mir jedoch bei einem seiner Leute, der mit allem Dahingehörigen gut bekannt sei, als Dolmetscher zu deinen, sobald er aus der Station nach der Stadt kommen würde. Hier war ein Dilemma. Die Station war ziemlich entfernt, der Dampfer, den ich bei meinem genau berechneten Reiseplan nicht versäumen durfte, war bereits eingelaufen und konnte jeden Augenblick zur Wiederabfahrt fertig sein. Dabei war ich durch das Verpacken einiger am Platze erlangter Sammlungsgegenstände beansprucht und auch noch durch andere Besorgungen. Ein freier Moment musste indess geschaffen werden, worin ich mich nach dem in der Vorstadt gelegenen Polizeiposten begab und dort einen schwarzen Unteroffizier ausfindig machte, der zu den Intelligenteren seines Gleichen gehörte. Freilich war sein specifisch-australisches Pidgeon-English mit so vielen technischen Wendungen durchwebt, dass das Verständniss allerei Hin- und Herfragen erforderte. Damit gingen viele Minuten verloren, und doch andere, bis richtig aufgefasst war, was ich eigentlich wolle, dann war das Holz zu beschaffen (und zwar die für Kerben geeignete Art), dann ein Messer, was, wie immer in solchen Fällen (wenn es auf Eile ankommt), gerade nicht bei der Hand war, darauf der Brief zu schreiben oder zu schneiden, ferner zu erklären – und für das Ganze blieb mir kaum eine halbe Stunde. Ich fühlte mich deshalb von dem Resultat auch im Grunde nur wenig befriedigt, und unzufrieden mit mir selbst, da über mehrere der Cautelen, die gerade bei einer Untersuchung so hochwichtiger Art auf das Strengste hätten festgehalten werden müssen, allzu leicht fortgeschlüpft war, von dem Ticken der Taschenuhr gedrängt. Indess, wie die Sachen lagen, mussten sie gelassen werden, und mir blieb nichts übrig, als mich einzuschiffen."

She wrote: "I figured out that the small waves at the end of the lines in picture one (4696/97) are hyphens. So If I’m not mistaken most of the missing words are actually just endings. The only words missing in the account of the shipwreck are what I interpret as “Ausfahrt”, “Herfahrt” and something illegible with the German ß at the end. Therefore, it might be something old I don’t know.As to picture two (4700), the sentence does not really make sense, especially the verb “trägt” but I’m almost certain my interpretation of the handwriting is correct in this case. Maybe the author himself left out a word."    Piers marked up location info (".... W. Australien) and material in far right column for review by Anneke H. She wrote in reply: "What I can say for certain is that the horizontal red circle to the right contains “cm lang Australien”. Which of course doesn’t make any sense. The “cm lang” is part of the description of the message stick (29,5cm long). The “Australien” may be the extension of the column to the right (vertical circle). Concerning the right circle I’d say the first word starts with a capital G and I would bet it continues over the next line because the next word starts with what looks like an h or f. There are not many German words this length starting with an h or f. It does look like “Gef-hart…horn” but that’s not even a word. I’ts very likely the passage end with “Carl Sahl in Sidney” but to be honest, without your hint I wouldn’t have read “Carl” because the ending is that blurry. What’s really interesting is the modern, not Sütterlin e in Sidney.     I can’t really make sense of the writing in the horizontal circle to the left containing W. Australia but noticed some oddities there as well. The hand writing looks different from the rest. First of all it’s written in pencil instead of ink. And the capital A looks different and a lot newer. It’s possible this was written later and by a different person. The numbers following the “W. Australien” look like this person referenced a different section or message stick. If you have the corresponding files “2582 u[nd] 2233/36” they might give you a hint on what the author tried to reference. And he had a terrible handwriting, that’s for sure."    Piers replied: "Thanks Anneke,   This is really useful. I had incorrectly guessed that "cm lang" was "sammlung"!    The crossreferences to other artefacts aren't usually helpful. Often they are preceded by "dgl." which stands for dergleichen and the comparison is usually on the basis of visual similarities rather than origins.    My bad guess for the words preceding W.Australien was something like "dorf__ W. Australien". There are very few settlements in the north west of Western Australia, where I suspect the artefact comes from, but the word doesn't like any village I know from that area. (In fact, I lived in that region for three years.)    Thanks again for taking the time with this,  Piers"    Anneke replied: "“Dorf” could be possible but the first letter is a little too small to pass for a capital D. Plus, the capital W and A are not written in Sütterlin style. Therefore it seems likely the author would have written a modern D as well. Yet again, this is just a wild guess. Said letter could also be “v” followed by “o” and… something “h”-ish. Maybe “f” but “h” seems more likely because the lower… how do you call that? Anyway, the lower part of the letter is not strait but bent.    In writing that I just realized the next word is most certainly “sicher”. What I first thought was “u” looks more like “i” followed by “c”. That would make “…h sicher W[est] Australien”. Does that make any sense?    And a minor addition to the part on the right (it seems I’m having way too much fun deciphering this): if the first two lines are still written in Sütterlin, the first word on the second line could be “herrn”. That would make “Ge…- herrn Carl Sahl in Sidney”. Again, all the letters in Sahl and Sidney look much more modern than the rest, so the two words in the beginning could contain a mixture of old and new letters. Anyway, I doubt that whatever is written there contains a specific location.    I hope that helps. If you come across another illegible passage, feel free to ask me!

Note that the responding message stick (WWT1926P424F3) is listed as originating in Atherton, Cairns District, Queensland. This strikes us as more likely since there is no Atherton in Cape York.     Atherton and Tully are in the Djirbal linguistic area and Cedar Creek is a long way away in the Turubul linguistic area northwest of Brisbane. Linguistic area is thus given as Djirbal.

Research notes: In Tylor papers PRM ms collections, Howitt 3 Howitt writes: 'In the matter of message sticks I have been at work for a long time. I have secured some which I will send to you. After I have made careful drawings of them for future use. I have not yet found one instance where the marks upon them convey any meaning by the blacks from which [insert] whom [end insert] they have been obtained. They say the marks are only for ornament and that the "stick" is more of a token to accredit the messenger. This does not disprove the positive statements made eg by Mr Dawson that in some places the marks have a meaning. So far I cannot find an instance either in South Australia, Queensland, New South Wales or Victoria. Message sticks were not known to or used by the Kurnai. The messenger sometimes carried a boomerang, shield or spear as a token from the sender of the message.' It is therefore possible that these message sticks came from Howitt to Tylor.    Letter 4: I must now explain the delay in procuring for you the humming instrument and the fire stick which you expressed a desire to obtain. I have now one tundun (Gippsland) one Bribbun (Queensland) and I expect shortly several others. [2] It is not however easy to procure these as the blackfellows dont like to give them up nor tell let white people see them. I have also a fire drilling apparatus from Queensland; I shall shortly have one belonging to the district and I am promised another from southern Queensland. I hope also to procure others. So soon as I obtain those or others, or find that the delay will be too long I shall send the collection off to you with further particulars.

It just says message stick. It looks like a cigar. Nora Pearce and June Simmons.’ Curatorial note: ‘Message stick, Australia. There was much discussion amongst anthropologists in the late nineteenth century about the use of message sticks in different parts of Australia. It was thought that they were widely used and would have served a range of functions such as signifiers of safe passage through new territories or as invitations. It has been suggested that the notches on the stick probably acted as reminders rather than as a language that could be read. Today they stand as an icon of Australian Aboriginal culture. This particular message stick was found with the donor's father and grandfather's papers after their deaths and little is known of its provenance or use. Museum accession number: 1990.36.1.’ [OD 28/10/2002]."	Julia Bespamyatnykh	00-No_image_available.png	
PRM1989_46_6	A message stick held in the Pitt Rivers Museum	interpreted_artefact  localized_artefact  PRM-1989.46.6	Notched message stick	 	1883	terminus ante quem	Diamantina River, Queensland	Message stick in a collection	traditional	QLD	Chirila: Karuwali  Austlang: L35: Karuwali  Glottolog: karr1236   	 	 	Diamantina River, Queensland. This message stick is associated with Howitt even though it is not sketched in Howitt (1889) or Howitt (1904). The best estimate at this stage is that the Diamantina River group is that defined by Howitt in "The Dieri and other Kindred tribes" (1891): "The Wonkurapuna lived between the Diamantina River and Cooper's Creek, and to the north of the Yerawaka [Yawarrawarrka]". The best guess that meets this description is Karuwali. There are no synonyms approximating Wokurapuna in Austlang. 	 	"The notches indicate the number of men invited to attend a meeting, the details being verbally filled up by the messenger." (PRM Catalogue)  "Message stick used on the Diamantina River, Queensland.

RMV642_8	A message stick held in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde	 	"The collection donated by Mary Bundock in 1888 to the RMV included two message sticks. There are not many preserved in museums. And are not known from the Richmond River District."    Updated description from RMV:  "Briefstokje uit één stuk geelkleurig hout gesneden dat met rode kleurstof is bedekt. Versierd met parallelsgewijs ingesneden verticale groeven en dwarsgroeven die elkaar kruisen. De ingesneden figuren hebben hun betekenis, men brengt daardoor bepaalde mededelingen over.    A short stick of light coloured wood with a series of short, narrow grooves or notches, 'V'-shaped in section, cut along the sides giving the piece of wood a quadrangular cross section. These cuts are reminiscent of 'tally grooves', and of the series of short grooves found on rock engraving sites in the Grafton district of the Clarence valley, and in north-eastern South Australia. Such rock engravings are not found in the Richmond River district. The longer grooves on the message sticks are cut on nopposed sides (nineteen on one, twenty on the other) as are also the shorter grooves (fourteen on one side, thirteen on the other). The message stick measures 9.9 x 1.2 x 0.9 cm.    The pair of message sticks is a unique specimen. No other examples from this area are known, and there is only one reference to their use in the local literature. Bray (1923:7) mentions that 'messages from tribe to tribe were carried verbally except very important ones. This [sic] were marked on a stick by means of notches'. To the south we have records of their use at Port Stephens (Scott 1929:33-4), but unfortunately no description of their features. To the north in Queensland such stick were used, and there are surviving examples in the Queensland Museum's collections. Some of these bear notches, as do the Richmond River specimens, though the particular examples do not come from south-east Queensland (see Hamlyn-Harris 1918:19, 20, 26, 27). Such message sticks apparently served a double purpose; they were 'memory sticks' for the bearer, and guarantees of his good faith as he travelled through the territory of different tribal groups. There seems to be little information on their use in eastern New South Wales, though they are reasonably well documented for other areas such as the Darling basin and central Australi (Hamlyn-Harris 1918; Howitt 1904:678-710)."

RMV642_9	A message stick held in the Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde	 	RMV Catalogue: "A message stick was intended to convey messages: the incised characters were legible for initiates. At the same time they were also a reminder to the wearer and they served as a certificate of good conduct as he traveled through the territory of another clan"    UPDATED entry:  "Briefstokje uit één stuk geelkleurig hout gesneden dat met rode kleurstof is bedekt. Versierd met parallelsgewijs ingesneden verticale groeven en dwarsgroeven die elkaar kruisen. De ingesneden figuren hebben hun betekenis, men brengt daardoor bepaalde mededelingen over.    De ingesneden figuren hebben hun betekenis, men brent daardoor bepaalde mededelingen over.    A short stick of light coloured wood, pair to 642.8, also with short 'tally grooves' or notches cut along the margins and sides, the longer and shorter cuts made on opposed margins. There are fourteen long grooves opposed to sixteen, and fourteen short ones opposed to fifteen. The longer cuts, steeper in section are across the width of the stick in both examples, the shorter cuts ('V'-shaped in section) produce a dentated edge down the side of the stick. It measures 8.5 x 1.1 x 0.9 cm. In both these examples the notches suggest that they were made with a metal tool rather than a stone adze or shell tool.    The pair of message sticks is a unique specimen. No other examples from this ara are known, and there is only one reference to their use in the local literature. Bray (1923:7) mentions that 'messages from tribe to tribe were carried verbally except very important ones. This [sic] were marked on a stick by means of notches'. To the south we have records of their use at Port Stephens (Scott 1929:33-4), but unfortunately no description of their features. To the north in Queensland such stick were used, and there are surviving examples in the Queensland Museum's collections. Some of these bear notches, as do the Richmond River specimens, though the particular examples do not come from south-east Queensland (see Hamlyn-Harris 1918:19, 20, 26, 27). Such message sticks apparently served a double purpose; they were 'memory sticks' for the bearer, and guarantees of his good faith as he travelled through the territory of different tribal groups. There seems to be little information on their use in eastern New South Wales, though they are reasonably well documented for other areas such as the Darling basin and central Australi (Hamlyn-Harris 1918; Howitt 1904:678-710)."  PK: All these references are in McBryde (1978)    Description from original RMV card file in Dutch (RMV642_9-IK_642-9.JPG): "kort rood gekleurd houten staafje (messagestick of kerfstok). De ingesneden figuren hebben hun betekenis, men brengt daardoor bepaalde med dedelingen over. Ovaal op doorsnede, langs beide kanten met insnijdingen,, waardoor een soort spiraalvorm is onstaan. Minder shuinse insnijdingen dan bij nö. 8. "  [...]  Verwerving: geschenk Miss Mary Bundock te Casino, N. S. Wales maart 1888.

MV_DT3050	A message stick from Northern Territory held in the Museums Victoria	localized_artefact  maningrida  arnhem_land	Summary: "This unusual piece was made for Donald Thomson who described it as a 'minature on a piece of wood'. Thomson noted it was the 'second bark drawing' done on 14th July 1935, the other being a bark painting by Wuluwirr's father, the famous Djapu leader Wonggu Mununggurr. These were the first paintings collected by Thomson in Arnhem Land. This work is very unusual being a painted onto a piece of wood rather than a sheet of bark. It is similar in size and form to a 'letter stick' or message stick, the surface of which is usually incised rather than painted. Wuluwirr produced two further work on bark for Thomson, and all these are the only known paintings by this man who died before WW2."

Physical Description  A neckband or headband made of glass beads possibly strung on European cotton/linen thread. A small wooden message stick is attached to one end.    It is referred to by Lindy Allen et al. 2018. 'Finding the signatures of glass beads': "The choker form closely resembles the tightly looped string headbands or ‘head filets’ worn on the forehead during high order men’s ceremonies by groups around the western and central Arnhem Land region. They are similarly long thin rectangular shaped bands with ties of various materials attached to either end for securing around the head. Two chokers from Adelaide River (X25838 and X25839) have a tiny wooden message stick attached to the end of the ties, and could indicate these were worn by messengers who travelled across neighbouring territories to notify other groups to gather for funerals, ceremonies and so on (see Allen 2014)." p57	 	1911	terminus ante quem	Adelaide River, North, Northern Territory, Australia	Message stick in a collection	traditional	TopEnd_arnhem_west_unlocalisable	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	375	30	20	Wood	 	 	Museum Collection	c. 1911	Museums Victoria	Item X 25839;  MX25839	Mr Gerald F.

 	Description of Woiwurrung message stick communication 	text_reference	From Brough Smythe, R. 1878. The Aborigines of Victoria: With notes relating to the habits of natives of other parts of Australia and Tasmania. Vol. I. Melbourne & London: John Ferres. p133:     "When a [unspecified Victorian] tribe is encamped, it is not permitted to any other tribe to approach the camp without warning. Bent on revenge, or with an intent to murder, or for the purpose of stealing a young woman, a warrior will sometimes invade a camp in the night and seek to effect his purpose, but such enterprizes are not of very common occurrence. Whether for friendly intercourse or for war, the tribe which seeks a meeting must give notice of its coming in due form. A messenger (We-ar-garr), whose duty it is to proceed to the camp and state the intentions of the visitors, or to invite them to come to the camp of his tribe, is formally appointed by the principal man of the tribe, assisted by the old men in council. The young men are not allowed, under any circumstances, to take part in such deliberations as may be preliminary to so important a matter as a visit to or the reception of another tribe. On very solemn occasions two ambassadors or messengers are appointed; ordinarily, only one. The messenger has to carry a token, by virtue of which he passes safely through the lands of the several tribes. The token is a piece of wood, eight or ten inches in length, sometimes round and sometimes flat, and seldom more than one inch in thickness. On it are inscribed hieroglyphics which can be read and interpreted, and which notify all persons of the nature of the mission. If the mission is a friendly one, the stick is streaked mostly with red-ochre (Werrup); but if unfriendly, or for the purpose of demanding satisfaction for injuries done, or for war, then it is mostly streaked with white-ochre (Ngarrimbul). The principal man, in putting this stick into the hands of the messenger, and having named the tribe for which the invitation is intended, says, “You hold this now” (Koong-ak kinee Mirrambinerr). “Look out and find plenty of blackfellows” (Yane-wat benjer oonee kolen). “You tell all blackfellows to come here” (Toombooni boole-anin kolen-yan-an niool or Tom-buk U-mar-ko Koolin Ner-lin-go)." 	 	1878	terminus ante quem	 	Positive text reference	 	 	Chirila: Woiwurrung  Austlang: S36: Woiwurrung  Glottolog: woiw1237	 	 	On 30 August 2018, Barry Blake wrote to Piers Kelly: "The language is the language of the Melbourne area, which I was calling Woiwurrung. I hesitate only because I think Boonwurrung was pretty much the same.  These words come from William Thomas, who was stationed in the Dandenong area for some time, on the Woiwurrung-Boonwurrung border.    Wirrap and ngarrimbal are confirmed, and I can translate most of the sentences. I'm pretty rusty. If it is important, I could look harder at the sentences.

Hamburg: Artien-Gesellschaft.: "Die Stöcke sind ca. 10–15cm lang und 2–3 cm breit; einige sind flach, andere rund und oft mit verschiedenen Farben bemalt. Ich habe selbst bei Herbert River einen solchen Botenstrock gesehen, und der Schwarze Empfänger sagte mir, er verstände alles, was darauf stände, ging hin einen ähnlichen Stock zu fabriziren und rizte die Antwort hinein: gerade und trumme Linien, unregelmäßig und ungeordnent, wie die erhaltenen"     Lumholtz, Carl. 1889. Among cannibals: an account of four years' travels in Australia and of camp life with the aborigines of Queensland. New York: C. Scribner's Co.: "I myself saw one of these sticks which came to a native among my acquaintances on Herbert river. The man told me that he understood the inscription perfectly well, and he even prepared a similar stick, on which he wrote an answer."

 	A message stick in a private collection, first acquired by the explorer Lawrence Allen Wells in Western Australia or South Australia	unlocalisable	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Richard Davies to Piers Kelly 28 November 2017:  "Lawrence Allen Wells was my great grandfather.    http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/wells-lawrence-allen-9043    I have shown pictures to University researchers in WA and they think that the stick came from the Mullewa/Geralton area, but it is guesswork. The stick may have come from from any of the WA areas he explored, and dates.... who knows.  I found the stick amongst my father's effects while he was very ill and close to death. I asked him about it but he couldn't even remember that he had it. I have bull roarers and boomerangs that Wells left to my dad. He had been given them by various Aboriginal people- probably in WA, though he did explore in SA until he was 73.    My wife and I have lived and worked with Aboriginal people for over 40 years in the NT. When I showed the stick to some of the Tennant Creek men they did not respond much. They would have told me had they any knowledge of such an object. We likewise have been given a plethora of artefacts from the Tennant Creek/Barkly Tableland region.    I have tried looking on the WWW for images of similar things but only found much cruder message sticks and so that is why I contacted you.    Thank you for responding to my email.    best wishes"    Piers Kelly replied: "Hi Richard,  How very interesting. I would say your great grandfather's message stick is plausibly from WA. It looks like others that I've seen from Western Australia at the Ethnologisches Museum in Berlin and at the National Museum of Australia. In a quick search of the database I've found this polished sandalwood style as far north Roebourne and as far south as Rottnest Island.     You will notice that this one (on the far right) from the British Museum is very similar and it's from the Murchison district: http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=505450&partId=1&searchText=message+stick&images=true&page=1    I can give you access to the message sticks database-in-progress if you like, but it still needs a lot of tidying up. Just let me know and I'll generate log-in details.    Would it be possible for me to include your artefact in the database too? It's certainly a fine piece of work, and other experts might have more to say about it than me.     All the best,    Piers  P.S. Do you remember which university researchers you contacted in WA? I would be keen to know if anybody else is working in the area of message sticks. "	Piers Kelly	2017-Davies_04a.jpg;2017-Davies_03.jpg;2017-Davies_01.jpg

CE2010P37	An annotated rubbing of a Daly River message stick, made by Hermann Klaatsch in 1904  	glossed_artefact  interpreted_artefact  localized_artefact  arnhem_land	Corinne Erckenbrecht's description: "Klaatsch hat die Muster von Sakralobjekten (Tjurunga und Schwirrhölzer) sowie von Botenstäben abgezeichnet, abgepaust, oder er hat mit weichem Pflanzenfaserstoff Abdrucke von ihnen gemacht. Zum Teil sind die Zeichnungen der Tjurunga und Schwirrhölzer auch mit Nummern versehen, deren Zuordnung jedoch unklar bleibt. Sie können weder mit den Original-Objekt- nummern von Hermann Klaatsch, die teilweise noch auf den von ihm gesammelten Objekten erhalten sind, noch mit den Objekt- nummern in der Klaatschsammlung des Rautenstrauch-Joest- Museums in Übereinstimmung gebracht werden. Es liegen Zeichnungen oder Pausen von elf Tjurunga bzw. Schwirrhölzern mit Nummern sowie Zeichnungen oder Pausen von fünf Tjurunga bzw.  Schwirrhölzern ohne Nummern vor (zum Teilin zwei Hälften sowie Vorder- und Rückseite gesondert gezeichnet).  Neben den Tjurunga- und Schwirrholzmustern gibt es auch zwei sehr ausdifferenzierte Muster von länglichen Objekten, die wegen der vielfältigen enthaltenen Informationen aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach Botenstäbe darstellen. Eine angedeutete Schnur, befestigt an einem Ende des länglichen Stabes, weist jedoch auch auf eine Nutzung als Schwirrholz hin. Während eines der Botenstabmuster lediglich geometrische Längs- und Querschnitte aufweist, ist das andere mit geometrischen Schnitten und einer figürlichen Darstellung versehen. Ausführliche Erläuterungen am Rand der Zeichnung erklären die Striche oder Schnitte auf dem Holz als kalendarische Angaben (Tage, Monate, Mond) und verweisen außerdem auf drei Stämme, die gemeinsam einen Corroboree abhalten. Die figürliche Darstellung ist „The strange king" betitelt.  Wie weitere Notizen auf diesen (zweiteiligen) Blättern belegen, wurde dieser Botenstab in Daly River (im westlichen Arnhem Land, Nordterritorium) von einem Mitglied des ,,Mullock Mullock Tribe” angefertigt. Dem anderen Botenstabmuster sind zwar auch ergänzenden Erläuterungen hinzugefügt, es existiert aber keine Herkunftsangabe.  Wie mehrfache Erwähnungen von Botenstäben in den Briefen an Schoetensack belegen, war Klaatsch an dem Phänomen dieser einfachen Nachrichtenübermittlung sehr interessiert. [fn:61: So z.B. in Brief Nr.14 und Brief Nr. 33 von Klaatsch an Schoetensack, PHK] Auch zeichnete er die Anordnung der Einritzungen in einem Brief an seinen Heidelberger Freund auf. Allerdings zeigte er sich enttäuscht von der profanen Bedeutung der Zeichen: Die diagonalen Striche in die eine Richtung bedeuteten nichts anderes als ,,Unser ,tribe’ kommt in dieser Richtung” und diagonale Striche in die gegenläfige Richtung ,,Euer ,tribe’ soll aus der anderen Richtung kommen”; die aus diesen aufeinander zulaufendedn diagonalen Strichen zusammengesetzen Winkel bedeuteten: ,,Dann wollen wir uns treffen und zusammen Corroboree abhalten”. Klaatschs ernuuchterter Kommentar dazu lautet: ,,Ich hatte mehr complicirte Dinge erwartet und erhofft, werde meine Studien fortsetzen”[fn:62: Brief Nr. 14, S.25, von Klaatsch an Schoetensack vom 5.-15 Oktober 1904, Telegraphenstation Floraville bei Burketown, PHK]" p38    In Erckenbrecht, Corinna. 2010.

Cologne: Gesellschaft für Völkerkunde, Verein zur Förderung des Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museums der Stadt Köln.    JB Translation: "Klaatsch copied or traced the patterns of sacred objects (tjurunga and bullroarers) as well as the patterns of message sticks, or he made impressions of them with soft vegetable fiber. Partly the drawings of tjurunga and bullroarers are also accompanied with numbers, their assignment remains unclear. They can be matched neither with the original object numbers of Hermann Klaatsch, some of which are still preserved on the objects he has collected, nor with the object numbers in the Klaatsch collection of the Rautenstrauch-Joest-Museum. There are drawings or traced sketches of eleven tjurunga or bullroarers with numbers, as well as drawings or traced sketches of five tjurunga and bullroarers without numbers (drawn separately to split two halves as well as front and back).  In addition to the tjurunga and bullroarers, there are also two very differentiated patterns of elongated objects. They most probably depict message sticks because they contain diverse information. However, an implied string attached to one end of the elongated stick, also indicates it being used as a bullroarer. While one of the message stick’s patterns has only geometric longitudinal and cross sections, the other one has geometric sections and a figurative depiction.  Detailed explanations at the edge of the drawing claim the lines or cuts on the wood to be calendar data (days, months, moon), and also refer to three tribes that hold a corroboree together. The figurative depiction is titled "The strange king”. According to the further notes on these (two-part) pages, this message stick was made in Daly River (in western Arnhem Land, Northern Territory) by a member of the "Mullock Mullock Tribe". Although the patterns on the other message stick were also accompanied with explanations, there is no indication of origin.  According to several references to message sticks in the letters to Schoetensac, Klaatsch was very interested in the phenomenon of this simple communication. [fn:61: So z.B. in Brief Nr.14 und Brief Nr. 33 von Klaatsch an Schoetensack, PHK] He also sketched the arrangement of the carvings in a letter to his friend Heidelberg.  However, he was disappointed by the mundane meaning of the signs: the diagonal strokes in one direction mean nothing other than “our tribe comes in that direction”, and diagonal strokes in the opposite direction mean “your tribe should come from another direction”; the angles composed of these diagonal lines mean: "Then we want to meet and hold Corroboree together." Klaatsch's commentary is: "I had expected more complicated things and hoped I to continue my studies”.

The design or marks on the stick, usually a small flat slab of wood, on a cylinder tapering at both ends, may help to identify the messenger and so validate his communications. Message sticks from Arnhem Land have vertical, horizontal and diagonal lines, diamond patterns and so on; with human figures; like those from western Arnhem Land, most refer specifically to economic transactions, and are accompanied by verbal messages. Ceremonial message sticks, in contrast, are distinctively shaped, bearing sacred designs, or take the form of raugga emblems, sometimes hung with feathered pendants, and sometimes made of ward beeswax. Mostly they refer to approaching rituals, or to ceremonial trade relations. The item is not mentioned in the Ooldea Report."    "bumerau, message stick.

A man came from Ilimar to the mainland as a messenger holding a 'gadgad' or message stick. He showed it to Gawidji, a lizard, inviting him and his friends to a ceremony. (rt.) All the gawidji men in human form went over to South Goulburn Island - 'Wiela', for the ceremony in their canoes (centre). As they stepped out on the island they changed back to animal forms (left bottom). The more central two lizards with black spots are 'gawidji'. The third lizard more to the right is a slightly different type of lizard called 'Marwagala' and to the extreme right is the goose 'Manimunag'. During the ceremony a fight developed between the 'gawidji' and 'marwagala' lizard and the 'gawidji' is knocked down (top right level). He dies and is put on a burial platform (to left of this level)."  ...  "Natural earth pigment on bark.  Red-pink ochre background on brown bark.

On that day several people who were camped on the eastern bank of An-gacha Wana, probably at a home base called Inanganduwa, had arrived at Lalarr Gu-jirripa to bring some items of material culture that they had made for sale.

"Whose store at Jimarda?" In Service delivery to outstations, edited by Peter Loveday, 50-56. Canberra: Australian National University, North Australia Research Unit.

Although relatively close 'as the crow flies' to each of these townships, large bodies of intervening water (rivers, straits, swamps) make direct access impossible. The only means of entering Jimarda are by way of a 120 km dry season track from Maningrida, an arduous sea voyage from either Maningrida or Milingimbi, or by light aircraft."

Mann river is more certainly within the Gunwinggu area, and the Cadell river in the Burarra area. What are the outstations on the Mann River that are Gunwinggu?    Murray Garde (2014, 104-105) wrote: "Using a ‘big placename’ to refer to an outstation can in some contexts create confusion when such big names have also become designations for other focal sites in the ‘estate’. An example of this involves the kun-bolkngeykimuk or ‘big placename’ of Kubumi, which was used to refer to an outstation on the Mann River established in the early 1980s by people of the Kulmarru clan. The kun-bolkngeyyahwurd or ‘small placename’ for the location of the outstation is Yikarrakkal. The focal place for Kubumi is a stretch of the Mann River where the river widens and white sandy banks are a popular camping place for people from the outstation, which is located only a kilometre upstream to the south. In the period of 1990 to 1997 when I lived at Yikarrakkal, movement between the outstation and the river camp was constant. With both the outstation and the river camp both being referred to by the name Kubumi, it became very difficult to disambiguate reference to these two places when speaking to people who did not live at Yikarrakkal. In 1990 the community decided to deal with this confusion by using the kun-bolkngeyyahwurd of Yikarrakkal for the outstation and the kun-bolkngeykimuk Kubumi, for the river camp. Kuninjku people in the Mann River region will refer to the outstation as either Yikarrakkal or Kubumi depending on their assessment of shared knowledge with interlocutors. ‘Big names’ are more widely known outside of the local sphere of interaction."  This is from Garde, Murray. 2014. "Doing things with toponyms: The pragmatics of placenames in Western Arnhem Land." In Indigenous and minority placenames: Australian and international perspectives, edited by Ian D Clark, Luise Hercus and Laura Kostanski, 97-121.    On this basis, my best guess for the Mann river outstation is Yikarrakkal (also, and formerly known as Kubumi). This is Linguistic area 1.   For Linguistic area 2, I have assigned Gunibidji (Ndjebbana) on the basis that this is the traditional language of Maningrida	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	Peter Cooke	 	 	 	12°30'13.6"S 	134°06'41.5"E	Absolute coordinates for Yikarrakkal outstation	 	 	 	 	PK to ask Peter Cooke if he was the messenger, and if the sender gave him a verbal message that he had forgotten or whether Cooke was asked to pass on the message	Piers Kelly	MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_01.JPG;MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_02.JPG;MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_03.JPG;MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_04.JPG;MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_05_cat.JPG;MAGNT-ABETH2785-Cadell_06_cat.JPG

SPENCER1914P133F36	Photograph of pre-initiates at Gunbalanya (Oenpelli) carrying ceremonial wands	localized_artefact  arnhem_land	This image appears in various publications of Baldwin Spencer including:    Spencer, Baldwin. 1913. "Preliminary Report: On the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory."  Bulletin of the Northern Territory 7:7-28. The caption is "Figure 3 — Boys carrying wands when sent out to summon members of distant tribes."     Later it appears in:    Spencer, Baldwin. 1914. Native tribes of the Northern Territory of Australia. London: Macmillan & Co. (The relevant description is on pages 35- 36).   The caption here is:  "Fig. 36.—Boys carrying the Wands called Uro-Ammi, when summoning Members of Distant Camps to the Initiation Ceremony. Kakadu tribe"    Better contextualising information is given in Spencer, Baldwin. 1928. Wanderings in wild Australia. 2 vols. Vol. 2. London: Macmillan. This information is reproduced in the 2008 Batty, Allen Morton volume, who include some editorial observations:    "Two Mengerrdji youths singing at the Gaagudju camp at Oenpelli during their travels prior to initiation ceremonies. East Alligagor River, 2 July 1912.  July 2nd  Late yesterday evening we were sitting in our mosquito-proof tent … when we heard a special singing, coming from the direction of the native camp. It was repeated again in the morning, when we found that the singing came from two youths who were standing close together facing one another, each of them leaning on a wand, coloured red and white. The song they sang was:  ‘Kadimanga,  Da laian a.  Da laian a.  Kadimanga,  Da laian a,  Da laian a.’  It was repeated time after time, and always the women, sitting in camp, replied with the refrain, ‘Wait Ba! Wait Ba!’’ repeated as often as they could without drawing breath. They sometimes do this fourteen or fifteen times. I often heard it thirteen, and naturally it dies away towards the close when their breath is exhausted. It is sung on a high note; the Wait is short, the Ba emphasised and prolonged. For days after the boys have come to the men’s camp they stand up every now and then and chant their song and, time after time, from camps, some so far away that you can only just hear the sound, comes back the refrain ‘Wait Ba! Wait Ba!’ it is one of the most picturesque of their songs, especially when heard in the bush at night time."[fn:21:Spencer, Wanderings in wild Australia pp.765-6]    [Eds wrote]: Every Gaagudju man has to go through five initiation ceremonial stages during his lifetime. The first ceremony marks the point where a youth leaves the company of women and children and is accepted as a man, the final when he is an old man.  The two Megerrdji youths photgraphed here were visiting the Gaagudju camp at Oenpelli during a tour prior to their beginning the second stage of initiation. The wands they carry were instruments of save passage from one part of the country to another, made by themselves under the supervision of the elders. p151      From the SLSA: "Two Aboriginal men carrying message sticks after setting out to summon members of distant tribes to initiation ceremonies on Melville Island, Northern territory. photograph; 9 x 15 cm  Magazine cutting."

SLSA_PRG280_1_11_60	Photo of Aboriginal man carrying a message stick	 	State Library of South Australia description: "An Aboriginal man carrying a message stick; location unknown, possibly in the Northern Territory."     This image was cut and pasted into Searcy's scrapbook but it is likely that Searcy sourced it from:  Spencer, Baldwin. 1913. "Preliminary Report: On the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory."  Bulletin of the Northern Territory 7:7-28.  This is where he sourced another Baldwin Spencer image of messengers.     Sadly the NLA copy is missing all accompanying images [the originals are problem at Museums Victoria] but it does include this caption:     Figure 4.—Aboriginal carrying message or “Paper yabber.” n.p.    Note that Spencer reserved the term "paper yabber" for a pen-and-paper letter and it looks like he has amended the caption from "yabber" to "wand" (For Spencer a paper wand is not so much a message stick as a ceremonial object that confers passport like protection status).

MIRAGE1974	A message stick sent from Midui on Maragulidban Creek into Maningrida	interpreted_artefact	Our special correspondent up the creek. 1974. “Mechanical humbug strikes again!!” Maningrida Mirage 3 (31):2-3.  Mechanical humbug strikes again!!   Boat motors gave some people up the Liverpool River last week-end “big mobs of humbug”.  The first victim was John Hunter. John was on his way to visit the people at Maragulidban, taking an icebox to help them start a fishing business. He went up Maraguildban Creek first and picked up young Ivan Louie, one of the Peter Maryewongas sons at the top landing. Then they set out for Midui, the landing on the Liverpool River where the fishing boat was waiting.  A few hundred yards from the mouth of the creek the propeller stopped turning. John check out the shear pin and as that was ok, decided a broken drive shaft was to blame. John and Ivan Louie spent [2] Saturday night battling the mosquitoes and sandflies on a mud flat behind the mangroves. They expected the Gunwinggu boat Midui to come looking for them on Sunday but it didn’t show up. About 2pm the Pinders and Peter Cooke arrived on the scene in a 10ft boat. They took Ivan Louie back to the Maraguilidban Creek landing and were heading back to pick up John when their motor gave up the ghost.  John was waiting expectantly on the bank when they paddled into view about 6pm.  With a full moon to light the way and the guide with them they set out for Maningrida, 17 miles distant. They were nearing the junction of the Liverpool and Thompinson Rivers when a search party in the Crocodilus boat took the little boat in tow.   On Monday, Micky Nalaulman arrived back from a fishing trip with an icebox full of Maragulidban Creek barra and a message stick from the captain of the Midui, Curly Bagalubu.

Unusual item in terms of size. Pokerwork and incised on one surface and slight incised on the reverse."  eBay item number:164435611992  PK inquired about provenance. The reply from seller: "  New message from: tarook22 (730Purple Star)  Hi there,  I purchased this with a group of other tribal items at auction a few years back. I don’t know who the previous owner was. It’s clearly an aboriginal item as evidenced by the pokerwork and the incising. I’ve estimated the age as 1950s based on all the other aboriginal items I have collected over the years.  Kind Regards  Brent"	Piers Kelly	20201010-ebay-s-l1600_00.jpg;20201010-ebay-s-l1600_01.jpg;20201010-ebay-s-l1600_02.jpg;20201010-ebay-s-l1600_03.jpg;20201010-ebay-s-l1600_04.jpg;20201010-ebay-s-l1600_05.jpg;20201010-ebay-s-l1600_06.jpg;20201010-ebay-s-l1600_07.jpg;20201010-ebay-s-l1600_08.jpg;20201010-ebay-s-l1600_09.jpg;20201010-ebay-s-l1600_10.jpg;20201010-ebay-s-l1600_11.jpg
